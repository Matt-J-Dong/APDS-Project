Make sure to `pip install -r requirements.txt` before running code, to ensure that you have the necessary Python packages.

`data-collection`
`deprecated` contains all of the old code that we worked on previously that is not currently being used in the project. We have kept this code for record keeping, but also may revisit some originally scrapped ideas present within this folder later on.
`regression-models` contains the code and data that we utilized for our regression financial models. It also includes our final results for each of the companies that we have analyzed.
`sentiment-scores` contains our sentiment score data as well as the code used to generate the sentiment scores. There is more detailed information on how to run and what is present within the sentiment score script in `sentiment-scores/Usage.md`.
