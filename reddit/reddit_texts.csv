2025-02-23T17:26:49Z,I built an iOS app for checking gas &amp; EV charging prices via CarPlay ‚Äì OctaneBuddy
2025-02-23T17:26:49Z,"Hey r/apple,

I wanted a way to check gas prices while driving via CarPlay, but I was surprised that no app offered this. Since I drive a car that requires premium and a full tank is over 50L, even saving a few cents per litre adds up quickly. So, I decided to dive into iOS development and build my own solution‚ÄîOctaneBuddy (https://apps.apple.com/us/app/octanebuddy/id6738063165).

What started as a personal project is now on the App Store (**with no ads, no data collection, and no subscription**‚ÄîI originally built it just for myself). Since launching, I‚Äôve been adding features based on user feedback, including:

‚úÖ Gas price support for the **US, Canada, UK, and now Germany**! üá©üá™ (With **Australia &amp; Austria** coming soon)

‚úÖ EV charging station support (mostly tested in the US &amp; Canada, but should work worldwide!)

‚úÖ Support for **Diesel**, **E85**, and more fuel types

I‚Äôm planning to work on a widget next and will also be refining the UI based on feedback. If you install the app, I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts! There‚Äôs a ‚ÄúContact me‚Äù button in the app for direct feedback, and if you spot any bugs, I‚Äôll fix them ASAP.

Let me know if you‚Äôd like to TestFlight beta releases before they go live! This is my first ever app and I‚Äôm new to Swift so bear with me :) I‚Äôd like to make more apps so if you have ideas for a ‚Äúsimple‚Äù app that doesn‚Äôt exist or isn‚Äôt done well and would benefit many, lmk!

Thanks, and happy driving! üöó‚õΩ‚ö°

Edit: if you'd like to TestFlight, I'd be happy to add you! Please hit the ""contact me"" button in the app or send an email to [sid@siddharthnatamai.com](mailto:sid@siddharthnatamai.com) so I can add your email to the TestFlight group. Thank you!!

Edit 2: Also gonna seriously look into CloudKit and make a proof of concept app where users can snap a pic of the gas station pump and feed prices into a database for other users to view. Maybe it can be turned into a mini game of sorts :)

Edit 3: Widgets and initial install/launch bug fixed and on the way to TestFlight users and App Store soon (hopefully by tomorrow). This will be version 1.5.5"

2025-02-23T12:21:44Z,"I made an app to help you tackle habits more easily through Habit Stacking (NO Ads, Privacy Focused)"
2025-02-23T12:21:44Z,"Hello everyone! I‚Äôd like to share a bit of a story around how I launched my very first iOS app. At the middle of last year, I was obsessed with productivity systems and scrolling productivity subreddits in the hopes that I would finally find something that would fix my life. This is when I stumbled on the concept of habit stacking - the idea of linking new habits to existing ones. I started small: after pouring my morning coffee, I would write the three tasks I needed to get done for the day. After brushing my teeth, I would meditate for five minutes.

I needed a way to keep track of the growing sequential habits but none of the apps I found on the Appstore really captured the way how habits naturally flowed together - so I spent my weekends and hours after work since developing Chayn using SwiftUI. It was a steep learning curve but finally ‚Äúfinishing‚Äù (if there is any such thing) and hitting publish made it all worth it. It‚Äôs [now available to download on the app store.](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/chayn-stack-habits/id6741157498)

**Key Features:**

* Ability to stack habits (both in sequence and in parallel)
* Track your moods
* Keep track of total time spent on habits + streaks
* Customise each habit and habit stack to your liking
* Make your habits as detailed or as simple as you want

Feel free to reach out with any requests for new features and/or feedback that you might have on the app if you decide to try it out. Have a great rest of your day!"

Did a return - they didnt even ask for the original back - thats how disposable they are / known problem is.  Went to Apple site and it had been pulled.

Got the new one - a few weeks - same fault.  Just logged second return .. again no need to send back and Apple are selling again .. for ¬£140 you would expect better... best avoided."

2025-02-22T12:17:49Z,"&gt;Apple just made a huge move, but most people don‚Äôt realize it yet. While everyone‚Äôs focused on the new iPhone 16e, the real story is the C1 modem. The Apple C1 is the first in-house modem chip Apple has ever created. This shift could reshape how Apple devices connect to the world, much like Apple Silicon did for performance.

&gt;I got an exclusive behind-the-scenes tour of Apple‚Äôs modem testing labs, guided by some of the company‚Äôs top engineers. In this video, I‚Äôll break down how the C1 modem works, why it matters, and what it means for the future of Apple‚Äôs ecosystem. From improved power efficiency and seamless A18 processor integration to potential future advancements like millimeter-wave 5G, the C1 is Apple‚Äôs first step in total modem independence.

2025-02-23T14:15:53Z,"Hi everyone! I‚Äôm a software developer who has been caring for pets for over 12 years, helping over 30 cats and dogs. While it‚Äôs been incredibly rewarding, staying on top of everything‚Äîvaccinations, medications, new symptoms, and emerging problems‚Äîhas always been a challenge. Life gets busy, and things can slip through the cracks, sometimes leading to preventable health issues.

Over the years, I searched for a tool that could help me log almost everything about my pets and provide actionable insights to make better care decisions‚Äîbut I couldn‚Äôt find one that fully met my needs.

üåç **Traveller-Friendly:**

2025-02-23T16:09:28Z,"Hello Guys!

I released an expense tracker app called [Finma](https://finma.money) last week. There are 1000s of expense tracker apps, so why did I make another one? I'll explain in a few points why I made it and what differentiates it from others: 

**Why did I build this?**  
\- I live in India and wanted an app that could track all my bank accounts and credit cards in one place, *automatically*!  
\- Automatic tracking was the key here, I'm lazy and hate manual expense entries.  
\- Started building Finma around 2 years ago, there were 0 apps that supported auto-expense tracking for credit cards and bank accounts in India on iOS.

**How does auto-expense tracking work?**  
\- Finma directly connects to your email, searches for transaction alerts and statements sent by your bank and automatically creates transactions entries.  
\- A rules features allows you to create keyword based rules and auto-tag transaction based on your usage.  
\- To ensure 100% accuracy, I have built-in support for most Indian banks. Post launch, thanks to users I'm slowing adding custom PDF parsing support for more International banks.

**Where does AI come in the picture?**  
\- For statements that I haven't added custom support, I use OpenAI or Google Gemini to extract transactions from PDFs.  
\- Automatic category suggestions  
\- Some other areas where AI is used is automatic transaction extraction from bank email alerts, helping with regex, etc.

**Privacy**  
\- Built with privacy in mind, I do not store any financial data on any server. All user data is stored locally on-device.  
\- I try my best to process PDFs and emails locally.  
\- Any data that does get sent over to AI services is anonymous and is not linked to the user.

**Future Plans**  
\- Working on adding Plaid/Teller and GoCardless support for direct bank integration. 

\---

**Giveaway:**  
I'm giving away 4 promo codes for 1 year subscription worth a total of $100 ($25/yr sub). All you got to do is check out the app and give me some feedback -- both good and especially bad feedback are appreciated as I really want to fix the pain points first.

2025-02-23T09:38:56Z,I've built an app that translates your Apple Watch health data!
2025-02-23T09:38:56Z,"Hey everyone!

Meet Livity! It's a health tracker that uses your Apple Watch data to show you stuff like sleep patterns, body recovery, and how hard you're pushing yourself during the day.

The big thing for me was privacy - I'm tired of apps that want to upload everything to their servers. This one does everything right on your phone. No accounts, no cloud stuff, just your data staying on your device where it belongs.

Main features:

\* Sleep tracking &amp; analysis  
\* Recovery tracking  
\* Daily strain monitoring  
\* Battery-style energy level  
\* Stress alerts when you need to take a breather

There is our Reddit community r/LivityApp where everyone can join and suggest new features / complain about the bugs (I always do my best to fix those, as Livity just became my full-time job!)

If you're into health tracking but don't want your data floating around somewhere, check it out:¬†  
[https://apps.apple.com/us/app/livity-sleep-health-tracker/id6498938838](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/livity-sleep-health-tracker/id6498938838)

Most of you hate paid apps so I will go straight to the point.  
The first overview screen is free for everyone where you can take a quick look at your day stats.   
More detailed data is behind the paywall.¬†

The main selling subscription is yearly which costs around 30$, which is around 2.5$ per month."

I'm thinking that the biggest consideration for someone like myself is the chip, the 16e has the latest, which seems to me will last longer/give better performance over 4-5yrs. 

Anything else I should consider? I lean 16e."

Is there a way we can transfer this icloud plan / access or whatever to the mothers existing account? So she pays for it monthly and can access it still? She just wants to keep everything intact and be able to access the memories etc.

Thank you."

2025-02-24T21:07:46Z,"So sorry for your and her/his loss. 

If you have access to her emails, you could reset her password so you know it and never be locked out. 

Can test resetting on your own device. 

You could also look to see if her pictures are downloaded onto her devices and could cancel the iCloud if it is indeed downloaded. The only concern that the phone will be the only access to it. Phones will sometimes fail. Motherboard broke. Storage. Battery swell etc. not common but it happens. Also it will get outdated in a few years due to later iOS and such.  

Could look to putting her photos and videos on another device so it lives forever."

2025-02-24T15:27:13Z,"For whatever reason, Steam is programmed to do that: once launched, it bounces in the Dock, disappears, then comes back again. If it doesn‚Äôt come back again, then your macOS version is most likely unsupported by Steam. I think Steam requires macOS 10.14 or 10.15 at minimum. What version of macOS are you using?"
2025-02-24T11:43:35Z,"I'm deciding between an IPhone 16/15 Pro. 

My pick would go to the 15 Pro (due to things like the better camera's, screen and higher refresh rate for example) but I've been reading a lot of complains regarding it's battery life. Are these still warranted? I'm hoping to have this one last a couple of years so having some headroom isn't a luxury... 

If the battery really is such a big difference that might be enough to make me opt for the 16."
2025-02-24T15:29:44Z,"Complaints about phones and battery life are almost as old as time. If you fully charge your phone, and then play Death Stranding on it for a few hours, the battery is going to turn to mush.

That said, the 15 Pro is no longer on sale, so any you see are either refurbished or used."

Unfolded it will probably be the same size as a current iPhone, so it'd probably be more accurate to say that you have the option to _halve_ your screen size at a moment's notice. Which is still valuable."
2025-02-24T18:30:30Z,"We don't know if it's gonna be a Fold type (folds open into an iPad Mini size) or a Flip (the one you mention a normal phone that folds in half).

Companies seem to be doing both, with the Flip style being the most popular (and cheaper) of the two."
2025-02-24T18:41:52Z,I'm not sure if Apple would bother with a Fold-style phone given how little it seems to care about the iPad Mini

2025-02-24T18:48:25Z,"The ideal case would be having an iPhone and iPad Mini in one device.

2025-02-24T17:43:26Z,"My 13 Pro Max is still great. Battery health is still in the high 80s and I don‚Äôt plan on upgrading anytime soon. The only thing I wish I had was USB C, but that‚Äôs not worth $1000 when this phone is fully paid off and works like new"
2025-02-24T18:06:55Z,"I‚Äôm with you on this. Still on my 13 pro bought on launch. So far, seeing the new releases, I just miss the usb c. My entire ecosystem is running on usb c."
2025-02-24T17:16:24Z,Was gonna buy the 16e until they butchered the price. Bought a 13 pro instead and I'm loving it
2025-02-24T18:22:52Z,"I just upgraded from the 13 pro to the 16 pro and honestly I can hardly tell the difference. Other than the camera, it‚Äôs
The same."
2025-02-24T17:18:37Z,"11 Pro Max says chill, son"
2025-02-24T18:06:13Z,"Just changed the battery on my 11 pro max, works like a brand new phone again."
2025-02-24T18:18:26Z,That's only a 3 year old pro phone? Just replace the battery and it'll last another 4+ years.
2025-02-24T17:17:28Z,All I want is a bigger camera bump
2025-02-24T18:52:18Z,"I'd legitimately buy an iPhone with a bigger and better camera sensor and lens. Like a 1"" or micro 4/3 sensor. 

Yes it would be bulkier, but having something closer in performance to a dedicated camera but with much better HDR capabilities and always synced to my cloud photo library would be great."
2025-02-24T18:16:54Z,"I want a camera bump at least as deep as the phone is tall, so I can use my iPhone as a set square"
2025-02-24T17:28:57Z,I think a flip iPhone would be very popular among young women.
2025-02-24T18:16:27Z,This is my favorite prediction so far
2025-02-24T18:54:09Z,How come?
2025-02-24T19:59:11Z,"I don't know if there's market research to back it up but it's always been my impression than ""flip style"" foldables are particularly popular with women because they can fit into any purse size, even extra small purses like the [Jacquemus chiquito](https://cdn.shopit.sa/products/01H8HS6EXD2ZBBCD4CYTT2613R.jpg) or clutches. Women's pockets (if they have them) also tend to be smaller than men's pockets so that also is a factor."
2025-02-24T17:37:07Z,"Give us a smaller phone, another mini please! Think different."
2025-02-24T18:02:49Z,A mini phone with pro specs updated every 3 years would be good by me
2025-02-24T18:09:30Z,They tried and it didn‚Äôt sell
2025-02-24T18:31:33Z,You‚Äôre the only one who would want one. That‚Äôs why mini was cancelled
2025-02-24T17:32:25Z,"I really hope that we get a clamshell foldable and it is a pro iPhone. It‚Äôs probably the only type of foldable I would be interested in. The weird aspect ratio tablet foldable just does not intrigue me at all. Even then, I probably wouldn‚Äôt buy any type of foldable if I have to sacrifice a lot of power battery life or camera quality."
2025-02-24T17:52:35Z,"There‚Äôs no time in the future I‚Äôll ever look at a folding phone and think ‚Äúoh boy, I want that‚Äù. 

It‚Äôs a solution where no problem exists. Not only that, it also adds a ton of its own problems. It‚Äôs like evolving backwards."
2025-02-24T18:12:55Z,This would be the first new iPhone I ever buy on release day
2025-02-24T19:35:27Z,Are folding phones in demand or something?  I don‚Äôt think I want my phone to fold.
2025-02-24T17:16:31Z,I wonder if it‚Äôs gonna be popular Samsung doesn‚Äôt sell -that- many and I feel it would be kind of annoying having to ‚Äúopen‚Äù my phone and be hyper fixated on that center fold..
2025-02-24T17:35:33Z,"We all know once Apple does something it gains traction and companies imitate it. It has happened with almost everything and will happen with this too. Plug/brick in box, notch, wired earbuds in box, list goes on and on‚Ä¶"
2025-02-24T17:55:59Z,"What do you mean by companies imitate it in this case?

Apple is like the last to do a screen like this"
2025-02-24T17:06:32Z,Sweet! That will be an easy pass.
2025-02-24T18:24:26Z,Why does this sub hate foldable phones so much? It‚Äôs literally just more screen estate. I‚Äôd buy one in a heartbeat.
2025-02-24T18:29:14Z,"They also hated big phones, and said 3.5 inches was perfect and phablets were a fad... Now they carry 7 inch phones.

Same will happen with foldables."
2025-02-24T18:50:35Z,I still hate big phones homie. I will use my 12 mini until it dies.
2025-02-24T18:51:10Z,It‚Äôs almost as if there are different people with different needs here.
2025-02-24T17:05:46Z,"Please be a flip phone half size foldable, not a giant square."
2025-02-24T17:26:46Z,I'll take the giant square
2025-02-24T18:21:35Z,"Same. My preference is an iPhone I can fold out into an ‚ÄúiPad mini‚Äù on demand, rather than a flip iPhone I need to unflip every time I want to use it"
2025-02-24T17:18:57Z,"This is all I‚Äôve wanted for awhile. I just want what I already have, but folds in half so it fits better in pockets. Otherwise my 15 pro is fine."
2025-02-24T18:18:37Z,"Knowing Apple, they‚Äôre definitely going to make the more expensive one first. Giant square coming near you."
2025-02-24T17:04:05Z,But y tho?
2025-02-24T17:07:56Z,To record TikTok videos obviously
2025-02-24T17:08:17Z,Because they struggle with any actual innovation.
2025-02-24T17:46:21Z,"The innovation is in the details‚Ä¶ obviously I haven‚Äôt seen  this imaginary product, but I would imagine that if and when it comes out, Apple will have solved the crease issue.

I don‚Äôt understand why people think the word innovate means ‚Äúbrand new idea that nobody has thought of.‚Äù It **can** mean that, but it can also just be about specific design of an existing product."
2025-02-24T17:26:16Z,Because nothing drives sales like a change in form factor.
2025-02-24T17:10:24Z,"I just want a refreshed iPhone 13 mini or SE 3 with the A18, 8 GB RAM, 128 GB storage, and an OLED display that doesn‚Äôt cost more than $500. Is that too much to ask for?"
2025-02-24T18:08:00Z,"You want the best smartphone chip in the world, produced using the most advanced chip fabrication process in the world, with an OLED display, for under $500. Of course that‚Äôs too much to ask for."
2025-02-24T17:33:37Z,"I‚Äôll settle for a Mini refresh with Dynamic Island, a 1000nit display, and the 16e‚Äôs 48mp camera."
2025-02-24T18:48:47Z,I'd pay iPhone Pro Max prices for a new mini.
2025-02-24T17:19:38Z,Not gonna lie foldable phone seems like a gimmick that very few people want/need
2025-02-24T19:04:23Z,Sales increasing every year from what I remember. Not something I‚Äôm personally interested in but obviously a growing market with a willingness to pay a premium.
2025-02-24T17:18:05Z,Could be wrong but I believe they will treat this as a new product category outside of iPhone or iPad branding
2025-02-24T18:53:35Z,BiPhone or TriPhone if they go with a 3 fold display.
2025-02-24T17:32:25Z,So glad I got the 16 Pro Max. Now I can wait it out and have my pick once all these new Apple made chips and iPhone design changes get sorted out ü•Ç
2025-02-24T17:50:52Z,I think most people don‚Äôt like foldable smartphones until Apple release their first model‚Ä¶
2025-02-24T18:09:07Z,"I can only hope that Apple continues to make Pro phones that don‚Äôt fold. Plenty of people will still want the best processor, best camera system, etc. without the folding gimmick, so I hope that continues to be an option."
2025-02-24T18:24:51Z,Ill believe it when i see it
2025-02-24T18:33:57Z,"They keep pushing it back, and for good reason.

When foldables first came out, they were shit. The crease was visible and dust could get in under it.

I've looked at new foldables from Samsung and Honor (Huawei). The crease is still visible, but a little less so. The actual crease looks ten times better these days, and the dust protection is better. I almost think it's time for foldables, though I still don't like the form factor. They do have their uses. I know Apple won't go for it until it's ready, and it will probably be ready by September 2026. Maybe this year, maybe not."
2025-02-24T19:11:39Z,I‚Äôve never understood the fascination with foldable iPhones
2025-02-24T19:49:11Z,I don‚Äôt want a folding phone. They will not last.
2025-02-24T18:23:32Z,Folding phones costs twice as much (at least) and last half as long (at best) so they're too enticing for Apple to leave alone forever
2025-02-24T19:17:12Z,All I want is a better battery
2025-02-24T18:49:53Z,"Unpopular opinion, but foldable phones are just a pointless gimmick, and honestly, smartphones have already peaked in design."
2025-02-24T14:48:26Z,"Jony is a great designer and artist, but great designers and artists need¬†***editors.***  
  
**Steve was Jony's editor.**¬†Once Steve was gone, Ive lost that critical editor. Cook gave Jony CEO-level reign per Steve's wishes,¬†*and Ive went rampantly in the wrong direction*, putting art and form over functionality on products that decidedly had to be usable.  
  
A MacBook Pro isn't JUST modern art,¬†**it needs to be a workhorse for 5-8 years**, not just look pretty on a shelf like some overpriced figurine you buy at an art gallery.  
  
Hence, MacBook Pro butterfly keyboards that looked gorgeous but didn't feel great to type on, and wouldn't work if a speck of anything got into them. Removal of usable features like HDMI ports, SD card slots and MagSafe? Thinness for no good reason at the expense of features or more battery life?  
  
I'm happy Apple is building products that are more usable than in the Ive era.¬†**Especially**¬†on their pro lines."
2025-02-24T15:27:23Z,"I want my MacBook Pro thick, with plenty of battery, with some actual ports, and some damn cooling. I‚Äôd say my current M1 Pro MBP satisfies most of that and I‚Äôm still very happy with it."
2025-02-24T15:55:30Z,"My M1 Pro battery is almost at 80% capacity after nearly 4 years. I see no reason to upgrade to newer models, just going to swap out batteries and push for another 4 years. Best laptop I‚Äôve ever owned. I was so excited when they brought back MagSafe and the SD card reader."
2025-02-24T16:08:58Z,"I have an affection for my 16"" M1 pro that I haven't felt for a computer since my commodore 64."
2025-02-24T16:17:18Z,It truly felt like a ‚Äúsorry about that‚Äù moment from Apple after the previous generation of form over function MBP‚Äôs. It‚Äôs aging like wine as well. I only feel the squeeze from having 16GB RAM when using Lightroom at times.
2025-02-24T17:02:06Z,"Have one for work, and it has easily been the longest I've used a machine without getting too frustrated by the limitations and wanting to upgrade. Our IT has a 4-year replacement cycle so I probably could ask for an upgrade soon, but I don't really see the point."
2025-02-24T18:40:04Z,"I just upgraded to a M3 Air after my faithful Pro stopped being capable of running programs *after 15 years*. Lack of MagSafe is one of the reasons I put off getting a new computer for so long.

(While I need the SD card reader, I couldn‚Äôt justify a $500 price premium for just that when an Anker hub is $30 and also gives me the HDMI port and two USB-A ports as well.)"
2025-02-24T16:52:31Z,"And this is the dilemma of varying opinions. The current MacBook Pro is as thick/heavy as I‚Äôm willing to go. I personally wouldn‚Äôt want any added thickness/weight, even if it‚Äôs in the name of better battery or cooling. A laptop should be portable by definition; any heavier and we‚Äôll be getting into gaming laptop territory (which I don‚Äôt define as portable).

For me, I‚Äôd rather Apple focus on improving what they have while keeping the same footprint. Any thinner and they‚Äôre wasting potential, but any thicker and it‚Äôs inconvenient to carry around."
2025-02-24T17:08:32Z,"I am in the unpopular category where I do want a thin MacBook, but I also want it to to have at least 3, preferably 4, usb ports an access for sd cards, and yes, a HDMI-access port. I don‚Äôt want to have to pay ‚Ç¨1900,- for that"
2025-02-24T17:08:06Z,"And I don‚Äôt. I want a portable device to become more portable with time. Nevertheless, Jony Ive was responsible for that 2021 redesign.¬†

When M1 was put in the same chassis as the previous Intel models, everyone suddenly started praising the design as the ‚Äúbest ever.‚Äù

It was Intel‚Äôs fault, and I‚Äôll be glad when they go bankrupt"
2025-02-24T18:56:13Z,"Same here. My M1 Max MBP replace my 2013 MBP, so I just kind of ‚Äúblooped over‚Äù the no MagSafe, no SD reader, touchbar era."
2025-02-24T21:21:59Z,"Honestly the current form factor of MacBook pros seems pretty idea to me. I wouldn‚Äôt say no to more IO, but other than that I wouldn‚Äôt be upset with incremental improvements for the foreseeable future."
2025-02-24T18:34:22Z,"This is spot on.

I also thought you were Jony Ive who forgot an apostrophe for a minute when you said ‚ÄúIve lost that critical editor.‚Äù"
2025-02-24T19:41:09Z,"&gt; Steve was Jony's editor.

A year after Jobs passed away, Scott Forstall was forced out of Apple. That's part of the reason lots of things went to sht. He and Ive may have not gotten along but together, they helped create balance between design and usability. When Forstall left, Apple mostly focused on design and usability suffered.

&gt; I'm happy Apple is building products that are more usable than in the Ive era. Especially on their pro lines.

Same. I refused to buy those butterfly keyboard macs and paid more to get a used 2015 under AppleCare in 2020 (the one I needed wasn't easy to find). I didn't want to get a newer model because I new how bad the 2016-2018 pros were in terms of functionality and the 2019 model still had too many issues. Now I have an M1 and it's definitely better than the 2016-218 models, in terms of functionality. I justr wish it was more repairable and upgradable."
2025-02-24T19:46:04Z,"Forstall had too much pride and didn't realize he was a mere rook or bishop on the board being protected by a king that had already fallen.

All he had to do was pen a 3 paragraph ""I'm sorry Apple Maps isn't up to par, it'll be our goal to improve it and I look forward to updating you in 180 days and 1 year from now.""

Instead he dug in his heels and Cook had to fire him. Jobs was able to mediate between Ive and Forstall... Cook was given the order by Jobs that Ive was untouchable, but no such order for Scott Forstall came."
2025-02-24T16:21:04Z,"This is such a good analysis, and I'm sure it's true. I have loved many Jobs / Ive era products, but agree that once Steve passed, some things started to go south."
2025-02-24T17:11:54Z,"South in‚Ä¶ what way? My dude, people have been crapping on Apple design for years, including when Steve was alive.¬†

The much beloved iPhone 4 design was CHASTISED when it was leaked. Everyone thought it was the fugliest thing ever, and it wasn‚Äôt a mock up. It was the real thing. And people thought it was so ugly it was fake. Same thing with original iMac mouse. Same thing with the Cube. Same thing with MacBook Air.¬†

If Apple isn‚Äôt getting criticized, that‚Äôs a concern"
2025-02-24T15:27:05Z,"The 2016 MacBook Pro was my first and only MacBook I‚Äôve bought. I loved the form factor but over time, I resented the 4 USBC ports, the stupid keyboard, and non upgradable ram or ssd, back when in 2016, those were still standard on many laptops. 

My 2 year old accidentally drowned it in Gatorade and I felt relieved to see it go. Went and bought an XPS after. 

Funny thing though, the same design choices that make a laptop infuriating to use makes iPhones so good. iPhones are better imo, when things are locked down, waterproof, and nearly portless. I like Bluetooth connectivity with Apple Watch and AirPods, just in a laptop, there are a thousand things that you just want a wired connection. Even if the conference room at my work or the study rooms o used back in college had Bluetooth, why would I go through the trouble of finding and connecting when an HDMI cable can just easily and instantaneously be used. 

I get those problems have been fixed, but I still have a feeling of irritation whenever I see a MacBook"
2025-02-24T16:04:45Z,Worst timing. I kept my 2010 MBP until finally replacing it with an M1 Pro because of all the terrible ideas that made its way into the touchbar/butterfly keyboard lineup.
2025-02-24T20:00:39Z,I kept using mine until 2020 and then got a used 2015 MBP (Apple was no longer selling them).
2025-02-24T15:41:27Z,"Dude you got t-boned on your learner‚Äôs permit. That doesn‚Äôt mean driving is the worst thing ever. 

I‚Äôve owned MacBook Pros from 2008 to now, my work bought me a 2016 and I hated that device so dang much I hoarded 2015s until the 14 inch MacBook Pros came out."
2025-02-24T17:21:58Z,Yeah I‚Äôd probably give the M series a chance if I needed a laptop. My xps is collecting dust now that my work provides laptops. But the M series do look pretty good
2025-02-24T15:30:15Z,So you got the worst MacBook Pro ever made and decided to apply your experience to every one before and after it that was way better?
2025-02-24T15:43:17Z,"Yes. First off, I don‚Äôt owe Apple anything. I have an iPhone because I like it but I have zero allegiance to the company. I gave them $3000 and in return, I got the worst MacBook ever made and had to deal with it for about 4 years. It over heated, keys stuck, and had zero expansion. So yeah, they lost me as a MacBook customer."
2025-02-24T15:52:52Z,"I‚Äôm not saying you have to bow down to Apple. It‚Äôs an understandably terrible experience and your own money they played with. Just pointing out the irony of you being in a thread where everyone is openly discussing how that MacBook was a mistake that was corrected and not representative of the vast majority of MacBook experiences, and that you are phrasing it like this is what Macs are like fundamentally instead of just a bad model. For the purposes of conversation, you looked potentially either ignorant or willfully misleading."
2025-02-24T17:19:44Z,"Sure, my point in bringing that up more to comment on Jonny Ives design decisions. 

Like I said, those same decisions worked, imo, really well on the iPhone but just didn‚Äôt translate well to a laptop. 

Wasn‚Äôt trying to be hypocritical, just adding a comment to  that period"
2025-02-24T17:50:00Z,"That aspect was an insightful point, for sure"
2025-02-24T17:38:57Z,I see someone reads Ben Thompson lol
2025-02-24T17:55:13Z,I‚Äôm more of a Snell and Gruber guy but Ben is insightful too.
2025-02-24T18:09:37Z,Love Gruber as well. I mainly mentioned because I have seen Ben use that \`Steve was Jony's editor.\` a lot in recent years :)
2025-02-24T18:24:16Z,"It‚Äôs very true, and I‚Äôm sure I heard it from one of those guys. The interesting thing is that unlike Tim or any of the bean counter C level executives, Steve Jobs would **really use** the prototypes and stress test. He‚Äôd spend an entire Sunday messing about with iPhoto or the calendar. No stone unturned, *pages of feedback on Monday morning*.

Nothing Tim or his executive team clearly are bothering with."
2025-02-24T18:26:57Z,"Yup, and it was very apparent when none of the execs wore Vision Pro on stage."
2025-02-24T19:42:28Z,"Work issues me a Vision Pro - perk of being the Mac admin... and it's undeniably a cool product. However, would I spend $3500 of my own money on it cool (plus tax)? **Certainly not**.

My biggest gripes with it are the lack of compelling apps (especially that there's no real game support with a controller), the weight being too much for long term wearable comfort (and I've got a 7.75 hat size melon dude head that can barely handle it) and the price being too high for any widespread adoption.

The other issue is that it's *very* isolating. When I've got it on, my wife/daughters become invisible and it removes me from the house, even worse than me staring at my phone or spacing out watching TV.

These are big issues that Apple is going to have to figure out if they want it to be a solid product line, long term. iPhone numbers it will never do... but even to hit iPad Pro numbers would be a mountain. 

Cutting the weight and price in half, and getting developer holdouts onboard with free development hardware... would be a good start."
2025-02-24T15:12:16Z,"Met Ive once, lovely guy actually, but before the first iPhone launched, he was pained to put a camera in a phone!"
2025-02-24T15:21:40Z,"Wow, one of the only nice comments here. Where did you meet him? That‚Äôs so cool!"
2025-02-24T20:38:26Z,"If he didn't want a camera on the phone back then, wonder what he must think about the enormous cameras jutting out of the back now haha"
2025-02-24T20:50:08Z,"If he was in the grave instead of Steve, we‚Äôd be able to power the world with his spinning."
2025-02-24T16:23:32Z,"By the way, I think your comment got hidden.¬†"
2025-02-24T17:03:43Z,I see it
2025-02-24T17:05:47Z,"No, i asked about how he met him, and because he didn‚Äôt reply, i checked his profile and saw a second comment that was ‚Äú[removed]‚Äù"
2025-02-24T17:20:36Z,Ahh. Fair enough.
2025-02-24T14:36:39Z,"From a design and functionality standpoint, I agree. They should not be trying to follow in Steve's footsteps. But Steve was also a brilliant marketer, and they would be foolish to throw away some of his practices."
2025-02-24T15:22:33Z,A reasonable and sensible comment!
2025-02-24T14:28:28Z,"Ive is one of those people that needs to be kept on a short leash when it comes to the kinds of unilateral design choices he makes. And he absolutely should never have the ability to override the technical folks. He has proven he will gimp the device just to make it ""pretty"". Which is a net negative when we are talking about a tool and not an art piece."
2025-02-24T14:30:37Z,I‚Äôm really curious about this. What are some examples of designs that he‚Äôs made that‚Äôs gotten in the way?
2025-02-24T14:35:14Z,"Bendgate with the iPhone 6, butterfly keyboards on the 2016-2020 Macs, Touch Bar having a virtual Escape key until 2020 come to mind"
2025-02-24T16:39:24Z,What about that MacBook with only a single USB C port? His as well?
2025-02-24T18:46:50Z,Unironically I think that 12' Macbook was too ahead of the time because othe intel chips. That thing overheated and shit battery life and shit performance like no other.Throw an M2/M3 in that bad boy and bring it back with an updated design and most likely it will sell.
2025-02-24T19:10:38Z,"I would disagree that the single port was a bad thing for that laptop. The form factor truly was the best ultra-light that could possibly exist. 

The problem with the MacBook was that it thermal throttled."
2025-02-24T15:59:37Z,I don‚Äôt get anyone‚Äôs hate on the iPhone 6. I think the 6 through 8 were the best ones. And mine never bent nor did it seem weak enough to ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
2025-02-24T14:33:13Z,Magic Mouse comes to mind I think
2025-02-24T15:11:23Z,"The Magic Mouse is the way it is because of Jobs. There‚Äôs a funny story about him looking at mouse designs and rejecting all of them except an early draft of a low profile mouse, and then the Magic Mouse was born."
2025-02-24T16:06:11Z,He wanted the port on the bottom because he didn't want people to use it while charging because the cable looked cluttered.
2025-02-24T15:52:56Z,"I don‚Äôt understand why they didn‚Äôt just drop the port and add MagSafe to the bottom, and offer a $100 mouse pad with MagSafe. Big L Apple"
2025-02-24T17:51:59Z,A $180 Magic Mouse with MagSafe charging? Who is buying that?
2025-02-24T19:50:13Z,"*Apple Consumers*. Besides it‚Äôs not like you need the mousepad, you can use any MagSafe charger. We‚Äôre talking about the same company selling mediocre folding keyboards for iPads for $300+ that sell like hotcakes."

Make the device 10% thinner with a 33% smaller battery. Thanks Ives. I would happily buy a 50% thicker phone with a 8000 mah battery, which also would keep the phone from immediately overheating in the sun or gaming."

2025-02-24T14:48:04Z,This one was the right call and it would‚Äôve paid off if Apple hadn‚Äôt simultaneously made the wrong call of keeping iPhones and iPads using Lightning for so long. The whole industry would be in a much more standardised place and I fully respect Ive for attempting to push things forward. Fees from MiFi gimped everything.
2025-02-24T14:57:50Z,"It wasn‚Äôt that they *added* the USB-C ports. It‚Äôs that they paired that decision with the *removal* of a bunch of useful and standard ports. Look at the Macs now: they still have the USB-Cs, but they now also have HDMI and SD card reader along with Magsafe. This is how it should have been all through, and I would blame the regression on Ive: too much focus on being pretty (‚Äúno extra holes!‚Äù) and not enough on what is used practically."
2025-02-24T20:56:21Z,"Yes that‚Äôs exactly right, and it was intentional. Thunderbolt can do the job of all of those ports, many of them simultaneously. USB, Ethernet, HDMI, Power delivery, all from one kind of port, over one cable. But because they didn‚Äôt give the industry *enough* of a push, we‚Äôre stuck with peripherals that require legacy ports, devices that have legacy ports, and a usbc standard that‚Äôs horribly fragmented."

2025-02-24T14:28:46Z,"&gt;Sir Jony Ive, the innovative designer of Apple‚Äôs iMac, iPhone and Apple Watch, and a close friend and ¬≠collaborator of the late Steve Jobs, says he still often asks himself: ‚ÄúI wonder what Steve would do?‚Äù

&gt;Ive told BBC Radio 4‚Äôs Desert Island Discs on Sunday that he does so despite the fact that Jobs had specifically told him not to before his death in 2011, aged 56.

&gt;‚ÄúHe used to say I really don‚Äôt want you to be thinking ‚ÄòWell, what would Steve do?‚Äô,‚Äù Ives said.

&gt;The designer, who was born in Chingford, Essex, and moved to San Francisco to work at Apple in 1992, worked alongside the company‚Äôs ¬≠co-founder and CEO five years later, when Jobs was called back in to help the struggling company after a period working elsewhere.

&gt;Jobs‚Äô return marked an immediate improvement for Ive, he recalled. ‚ÄúIt was remarkable that, despite the limitations of my ability to communicate, Steve understood what I thought and how I felt,‚Äù Ive said.

&gt;He told host Lauren Laverne that he feels Jobs‚Äô reputation as demanding and ruthless is unfair: ‚ÄúIf you have such a clear, pure view of ¬≠creating something new ‚Ä¶ if you are serious about actually wanting to develop and make it, you can‚Äôt just say ‚Äòwell, here‚Äôs an idea‚Äô because if that‚Äôs how you‚Äôre going to behave, it will remain an idea.‚Äù

&gt;He added that he couldn‚Äôt read anything about Jobs for 10 years after his death.

&gt;The designer, who grew up in Staffordshire, bemoaned the lack of understanding about art and design in many schools and recalled how he felt his intelligence was questioned by teachers because he was shy and wanted to spend time making things.

&gt;Fears that the technology he has helped to create could now be interfering with human creativity worry Ive, he said, adding that he finds it difficult to monitor his own use of technology. While he praised all the benefits that have flowed from the arrival of the iPhone, he said he feels a responsibility for the unintended, negative aspects. This is in his mind when he makes decisions about the tech of the future, he added.

&gt;Ive‚Äôs concern about the threat posed by AI is mixed with his excitement about its possibilities, he said. His main worry is the unchecked speed of development. ‚ÄúWe need time to understand and react,‚Äù he said. He did not give details of the AI project he spoke about working on last autumn with OpenAI CEO, Sam Altman, but is enthusiastic: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs probably the first time in my career that I‚Äôm inspired by capability in this way.‚Äù"

Do you really think it was just Ive who pushed everyone to implement this design? He also created 2019 Mac Pro which is fully modular.

2025-02-24T14:15:21Z,"From the article: Apple plans to launch a second-generation AirTag in May or June this year, according to a post today from a leaker known as [Kosutami](https://x.com/Kosutami_Ito/status/1893941895761444872).

Bloomberg's Mark Gurman previously reported that a new AirTag would be released in mid-2025. May or June would align with that timeframe.

Below, we recap three new features rumored for the AirTag 2:

* With a second-generation Ultra Wideband chip, the AirTag 2 is expected to have up to 3√ó longer range compared to the current AirTag. The chip debuted in the iPhone 15 and the Apple Watch Ultra 2. On the iPhone 15 and iPhone 16 models, there is a Precision Finding for People feature that can help you to find your friends in crowded places, and it offers a range of up to 200 feet/60 meters.
* The new AirTag's built-in speaker is expected to be more difficult to remove or tamper with, as an anti-stalking safety measure.
* The new AirTag is rumored to have improved integration with the Apple Vision Pro.

The original AirTag was announced during an Apple Event in April 2021. In the U.S., an individual AirTag costs $29, and a set of four costs $99.

Kosutami is best known as a collector of prototype Apple products, but they have occasionally shared accurate information about Apple's future plans. For example, they accurately revealed that the iPhone 16 Pro would be equipped with a metal-enclosed battery many months before the device launched. However, their August 2024 claim that new AirPods Pro would be coming ""soon"" did not pan out, as AirPods Pro 3 have yet to launch.

In another post today, Kosutami seems to be once again implying that new AirPods Pro are on the horizon, along with new Apple smart home accessories. Apple is expected to unveil an all-new smart home hub this year, and it is also rumored to be working on a Face ID doorbell and a smart home camera for release in 2026 or later."
2025-02-24T16:23:39Z,"Improved range will be nice. When I use them for luggage tracking, they usually can‚Äôt connect until the luggage arrives on the carousel. Would be nice to get the alert a little sooner."

2025-02-24T17:59:40Z,"One popular thing in enterprise VR is to have objects that can be seen in the virtual world but held in the real world. Perhaps this would better allow airtags to be used to motion/location track those objects in VR games/simulations/training, etc."
2025-02-24T20:15:39Z,"I remember an interview years ago, prior to the launch of VisionPro, where an Apple executive, speaking in generalities about the potential of AR or VR specifically mentioned how AirTags could be utilized within that context where a red balloon would float above the item in question."
2025-02-24T14:44:25Z,Really wish they would make a card version for use in wallets.

2025-02-24T20:42:48Z,There‚Äôs a guy on Etsy that disassembles AirTags and fits them into a 3d printed card that fits in your wallet. I have it and it works incredibly well! It has a smaller battery though so you have to replace it like once or twice a year but it‚Äôs great beyond that

2025-02-24T18:01:13Z,"I'm surprised there isn't a $300+ Hermes Wallet with an airtag built in. If you built it into the wallet then it wouldn't have to be as thin as a card since it could help makeup part of the structural integrity of the wallet.

Or maybe they want everyone to buy a wallet that slaps on the back of your phone, or never need a wallet because everyone adopts apple pay and virutal driver's licenses in apple wallet."
2025-02-24T20:57:59Z,"I would love to never need a wallet, but we still have a long way to go on that front.

Here in the US, most stores now accept Apple Pay, but a few big brands (notably Walmart and Kroger) are still holding out. Gas stations are also still about 50/50 where I live.

The biggest issue for me, though, is getting more states to accept virtual driver‚Äôs licenses."
2025-02-24T15:05:13Z,"I have an AirTag holder in my wallet. It's a 3d printed card. It could be thinner, but it's not bad."
2025-02-24T15:13:44Z,The problem with that is thosee are still thicker than 2 credit cards.  That is one apple needs is a simple credit card size one that is the thickness of 2 credit cards.
2025-02-24T15:31:45Z,"Yeah I know it's suboptimal, but mine is deep in my wallet and I don't even notice it. I may have gotten rid of some cards I don't use in order to compensate."
2025-02-24T16:34:59Z,My issue is the wallet I use holds cards only and a more minimal wallet hence why all the current option dont work as well.
2025-02-24T18:22:28Z,"Have you considered you're just holding it wrong? /s

I do wish they had more variety in AirTag shapes and sizes."
2025-02-24T18:40:05Z,They probably don't to indirectly promote use of Apple Pay.
2025-02-24T16:28:02Z,"Agreed. The third party options that you can find online work well enough, but most if not all of them that aren't just torn down AirTags don't support precision finding."
2025-02-24T17:03:47Z,"Nomad has one, very good, rechargeable too on magsafe"
2025-02-24T17:59:28Z,"Agreed. This is key. I know the 2032 battery wont fit, but make it a rechargeable flat battery or something. The tech is there. It won't be as flat as a credit card, but it could be 2-3 cards thick"
2025-02-24T16:14:12Z,"I have a 3rd party one and it doesn‚Äôt do precision tracking but that‚Äôs not exactly how I ‚Äúlose‚Äù my wallet. For me, I just like knowing that if I somehow leave it behind somewhere‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm going to get a notification and then I realize it happened. One day when they add precision finding I‚Äôll upgrade but this has given me serious peace of mind considering how annoying it is to lose a wallet."
2025-02-24T16:52:25Z,"I'm the opposite, I need precision tracking to find my wallet when it's in the same room as me lol"
2025-02-24T18:23:44Z,"Eufy‚Äôs card tracker has a pretty good speaker in it.  If you‚Äôre in the same vicinity, you would definitely hear it."
2025-02-24T14:55:28Z,We need a new chirp sound. It's so hard to triangulate.
2025-02-24T18:59:14Z,"Absolutely hate the chirp - Who in their right might decided to add an artificial echo to a sound you‚Äôre supposed to use to localize the position of something.

I would love to hear a reason why it helps, but all it really seems to do is throw me off all the time"
2025-02-24T21:00:14Z,"Yeah, it's a weird choice. Never had this issue with a Tile. Really frustrating when I've left my keys in a pair of pants in the laundry bin. It's literally like finding a needle in a haystack."
2025-02-24T15:01:10Z,"This is more a Find My feature, but I wish I could tune and customize the ‚Äúitem has been left behind‚Äù feature. Make some items more sensitive during parts of the day.

For example, if I leave my laptop at home on an in-office day, I‚Äôd like to know as soon as I pull out of the drive way, not when I‚Äôm a getting on the express way. Same with my wallet. I need to know I left it at the restaurant as I‚Äôm leaving, not when I‚Äôve gotten home.

I‚Äôm thinking maybe I could set some items as high priority when I‚Äôm out of the house, and have it monitoring the distance and telemetry of spatial change in real time, even if it sacrifices some battery."
2025-02-24T16:37:17Z,"I have the opposite problem, I get a notification many times when I am with the item with me (mainly the Airpods seem to have this problem). It happens so often that sadly I don't even check anymore cause I know I have it with me, will definitely lead to me losing something at some point.

But, any type of customization is welcome in my mind."
2025-02-24T18:30:51Z,"I wish you could link it to calendar events or certain days. I don't need to know I've left my passport at home the vast majority of days. However, the day I have an international flight I would like the reminder on, and if I'm in the headspace to forget my passport, I'm probably not in the headspace to remember to turn the Forgot Item notification on for it either. It's more of a Calendar app change than a Find My or Air Tag change, but add options to events to say ""On the day of this event, notify me if Passport left behind"", etc."
2025-02-24T21:00:34Z,"I don‚Äôt think that will happen because you need to apply the filter of tracking a person. If it‚Äôs tracking a person too well, you need more safeguards to counter. That‚Äôs likely how we ended with such a delay in notification."
2025-02-24T21:15:05Z,"It won‚Äôt happen because Apple doesn‚Äôt care and won‚Äôt ever think to do it.

However, the whole deal with ultra wide band is that two objects can understand their spatial relationship to each other. In this case, all your phone knows or cares about is how far away the object is, and after that number is too high, alert you.

You‚Äôre not tracking a person. You‚Äôre checking a distance."
2025-02-24T21:17:34Z,I wish it could integrate with the parking location detection and suppress warnings when I leave my stuff in the car.
2025-02-24T15:17:23Z,Improved distance is all I need. I feel like an idiot walking around my house waiting for it to find a signal.
2025-02-24T20:45:48Z,Look at this guy in his god damn castle /s
2025-02-24T14:29:33Z,"I know it won't happen, but I want full cross-compatibility with these trackers between Android and Apple.

Otherwise you go to an ""iPhone country"" and your Android tracker doesn't have good coverage. Or you go to an ""Android country"" and your AirTag doesn't get good coverage.

Also, Google went too conservative with the privacy features. It's not enabled by default on low traffic areas and needs multiple devices to be in range of the tracker. So, again, it makes it even more annoying to use it in an ""iPhone country"".

Not to mention being able to detect unknown trackers without needing a third party app installed just for that, for example.

Nor that even within Android I don't think they all use the same network...

Even if it isn't full 1 to 1 functionality, the networks being compatible should be ideal."
2025-02-24T15:42:48Z,"A standardization of a protocol would be ideal. That way, compagnies can make the chip how they want but they still get to be cross platform and working no matter the phones used. Everyone wins in this situation.

But given the stalking danger that‚Äôs already in place with the AirTags, I don‚Äôt expect Apple to have even 1% of interest in collaboration"
2025-02-24T16:06:02Z,"&gt; But given the stalking danger that‚Äôs already in place with the AirTags, I don‚Äôt expect Apple to have even 1% of interest in collaboration

Not sure how big of a problem the stalking really is. But if it is a big problem, then it makes even _more_ sense to have one standard network.

If I put an AirTag on someone that has an Android, they can't know they have an unknown tracker following them unless they actually installed the special App.

And I'm pretty sure it's the same the other way around, you can't know you have a Tile, Samsung, whatever on you with an iPhone.

So all you need to do to make it more likely to not be discovered, is use a different tracker from the phone your target uses...

I'm sure there are apps or ways to ""scan"" to see if there are any bluetooth devices around you or something. But it's not something that everyone has by default."
2025-02-24T20:31:10Z,"It does make more sense, but probably not on Apple‚Äôs mind. They‚Äôve been against opening protocols for years for ""security concerns"""
2025-02-24T15:19:26Z,I am 100% with you on that. I feel like Apple has locked it down to tightly behind their system that it will never happen. I can see google much more willing to just have an open standard that anyone can tie into and then have the info shared across platforms.
2025-02-24T16:10:34Z,They‚Äôll make a new everything except the AirPod maxes
2025-02-24T14:26:03Z,"I have a feeling they will severely nerf the ability to track an object after it‚Äôs been taken from you. The best use for these imo. 
They seem to now target these as a key ring finder."
2025-02-24T14:34:38Z,"It‚Äôs been marketed for lost, not stolen, items repeatedly. Never once, ever, have they said it‚Äôs for stolen items."
2025-02-24T18:54:10Z,People are definitely still going to use them for stolen items though.
2025-02-24T16:53:08Z,They've never targeted them as an ant-theft device
2025-02-24T18:17:55Z,I hate it when my ants get stolen! üò§
2025-02-24T19:29:12Z,"No, the ants steal your device"
2025-02-24T19:10:12Z,I never said otherwise.
2025-02-24T14:47:33Z,Umm never been marketed that way. It was always marketed as a way to fund your misplaced things.
2025-02-24T14:33:07Z,"Most people are using these to track items in case they get stolen, which obviously isn‚Äôt their intended purpose but that‚Äôs the market they appeal to. 

I know very few people that are using these things for their intended purpose."
2025-02-24T16:36:13Z,"I mean I have an AirTag on my keys and wallet in case they get stolen, but also in case they get lost outside, in my house, etc. I think both can be true"
2025-02-24T15:06:55Z,What is the intended purpose?
2025-02-24T15:08:45Z,"To help find misplaced items around the house. Keys, remotes, bags, etc."
2025-02-24T15:13:31Z,Not just around the house. You can misplace your wallet somewhere else. Just a couple weeks ago I left a sling at a Vegas casino after going to another. I was able to check the AirTag in my wallet to verify it was still there before going back to get it.
2025-02-24T15:24:08Z,"The one I see complaining about it the loudest use it incorrectly but honestly most people I know use them for their  intended purpose.  Tracking their own items not to make sure they dont get stolen.

Everyone putting them on their keychain is using them for that purpose.  The other purpose I use mine often times for is when I fly to track my luggage by throwing a tag in there.  It confirms if it made it on the plane or got left behind plus if my luggage is missplaced or lost at an airport I can then find it more easily.  
  
Another big one is I tossed one in my kids backpack when we go places. Mostly for the case when it gets dropped I can go find it more easily. Lastly when my family has gone to Disney land we toss a tag in the stroller. Mostly because it does get moved by the staff or moved in stroller parker so the tag makes it easier to find it.

Again all correct uses of the tag."
2025-02-24T16:54:08Z,Just give me a wallet-friendly version
2025-02-24T16:55:12Z,Just make it smaller and thinner. Nobody cares about extra features
2025-02-24T15:38:18Z,"&gt; The new AirTag's built-in speaker is expected to be more difficult to remove or tamper with, as an anti-stalking safety measure.

I hope they've figured out the unnecessary beeping then, because otherwise the value of Gen1 is going to rise

All of the other touted improvements are a 1 on my scale of importance when when compared with how annoying the speaker is. I leave an AirTag in my car and the beeping when I was driving was driving (no pun intended) me crazy."
2025-02-24T16:37:28Z,I'd like to see them smaller in diameter. So I can place them in expensive instruments that have a way of walking off. I don't care if people know they are attached. It's just a cumbersome size.
2025-02-24T16:41:46Z,"Finally, the killer feature I have been waiting for - Apple Vision Pro integration.  Now if they could just make the speaker loud enough so that you can hear it if your item is in a bag‚Ä¶"
2025-02-24T16:48:04Z,I‚Äôm interested in what the find my integration will look like with the Apple Vision Pro. It would be cool if the near by feature showed the location of the AirTag in your real space.
2025-02-24T17:05:26Z,"We got one to track the cat because he has a nasty habit of bolting out the door.  Last time he got out, he was in the neighbors back yard and the air tag couldn't find him until I was practically on top of him.  I heard his cries for help long before the tag found him.  Hell, half the time it won't even pick him up if he's still inside the house.  This is all my way of saying I'm excited for an extended range."
2025-02-24T17:20:45Z,I‚Äôd love one that didn‚Äôt require getting a ping from a device to locate to.  My luggage was stolen recently in Barcelona and I was chasing it down but ultimately I was always lagging behind it until I just found it in the bottom of a dumpster at 3am.
2025-02-24T18:15:38Z,"That would require a constant cellular or GPS connection on the AirTag itself, which would be expensive, require a much larger form factor, and make for a battery that does not last anywhere near a year.

[GPS dog collars](https://shop.tryfi.com/products/smart-collar-v3) are probably the closest currently available tech, and they are rather large compared to AirTags, have a three-month battery life, are expensive, and require a dedicated cellular plan.

So maybe get one of those for your luggage? No clue if it works internationally tho."
2025-02-24T18:05:56Z,How will this work with 16e that doesn‚Äôt have an UWB chip
2025-02-24T19:29:04Z,"It‚Äôll probably just have performance similar to the current AirTag then, it won‚Äôt exclusively work with devices that have the UWB chip, much like how 5g phones also support 4g service."
2025-02-24T18:49:06Z,"I got an AirTag for Christmas 2023, I love it. Granted, I haven‚Äôt needed to use it once but it‚Äôs cute to have. I got my closest friend one for this past Christmas. I have a 13 Pro Max so I‚Äôm doubtful the new model‚Äôs features will be of use to me, at least all of them. Time will tell"
2025-02-24T20:17:42Z,Hope they finally fix the bug with different AirTag locations showing on different devices.
2025-02-24T04:04:09Z,Hasn't it already for 99% of people? It's only really hobbyist now
2025-02-24T04:23:01Z,"Even as someone with a good ""real"" camera I don't have it on me the majority of the time. That's why I find value in a high end phone; if I'm carrying something with me all the time I'd like it to have the best camera available"
2025-02-24T04:44:05Z,"And the other thing is if you know you need a ""real"" camera, you know you need a real camera. Smartphones have made leaps &amp; bounds but no amount of computation or binning will beat the physics, low light performance, and dynamic range of a larger sensor"
2025-02-24T05:49:40Z,"For now. I‚Äôm a photography nerd and honestly it‚Äôs gotten kind of insane. I know there is a theoretical limit, but it doesn‚Äôt feel like it.

Edit: people pay me to take pictures, I know big cameras aren‚Äôt going anywhere. I just think it‚Äôs spectacular that a camera that is built into your phone can take a useable photo in a night scene since not that long ago that was out of the question for DSLRs."
2025-02-24T06:06:05Z,"The difference is that much of the improvements in smartphone imaging nowadays is due to software and signal processing- something the photographer has virtually no control over. So if you want full creative control, you will always need a standalone camera body and lens system."
2025-02-24T06:41:38Z,"Definitely. But at the same time, that feels like a lot of what‚Äôs been going on with mirrorless cameras now too, especially with improvements to dynamic range. The stacked sensors, the machine learning noise reduction, and the insane ‚Äúshutter‚Äù speeds sometimes feel like they‚Äôre as much software as hardware improvements, meanwhile optical improvements have felt a little stagnant. The A9III is the coolest most innovative camera that I feel like we‚Äôve gotten in a while, but it‚Äôs stuck with Sony‚Äôs boring glass. Canon has been pushing the boundaries of existing glass but it just feels like plastic-y versions of lenses that already existed (albeit with amazing new zoom capabilities) and I think that‚Äôs kinda boring. Weirdly, Nikon feels like it‚Äôs doing the most weird and exciting shit with their mirrorless glass, they just cost an insane amount of money. 

Like fuck it, make another 300 f/2, bring back the 200 f/1.8, and just generally push the limits of optics.

I want to make weird pictures with weird lenses. I don‚Äôt need a 32,000th of a second exposure at 102,000 ISO. Not everything needs to look like an Edgerton photo."
2025-02-24T07:41:11Z,"I don‚Äôt know if this is quite as bad as you make out.

The Nikon Z mount glass is absolutely amazing compared to the older mounts. New opportunities because of the mount, plus new design software is obviously making a huge difference in optical quality.

And as good as the new phones are, they still don‚Äôt hold a candle to the quality from a decent Mirrorless system. You can easily tell the difference when enlarging or seeing the depth of field vs the AI simulated ones.

And as far as ‚Äòweird‚Äô goes, there‚Äôs plenty of old and odd lenses that can be adapted to the new bodies - that produce images that just can‚Äôt be naturally ‚Äòprocessed‚Äô by software."
2025-02-24T08:16:56Z,"This, nothing beats a mirrorless system's true depth of field. You can really tell a difference."
2025-02-24T07:54:08Z,"Oh it‚Äôs not bad, I‚Äôm just being picky. I‚Äôm excited about the current state of and the future of cameras. I just also want some new weird mainstay lens. Like give me a 50-100 1.4 or something weird. Like just weird inevitable commercial failure lenses."
2025-02-24T06:18:46Z,I‚Äôll need a camera until it can replace very long and fast telephoto lenses. And that‚Äôs not gonna happen. Physics are physics.
2025-02-24T14:30:32Z,"The thing that blows my mind with my phone is how good a night photo it can take *handheld*

Sure, my MILC (basically the most recent evolution of the DSLR-style professional camera for anyone unaware of the acronym) can take a better night photo‚Ä¶ from a tripod. But my phone can do it in my hands

For me the main reason I still use my MILC is telephoto lenses - an iPhone maxes out around 120mm equivalent whereas my longest lens gets out to 480mm. There‚Äôs [really no substitute for focal length](https://photographylife.com/telephoto-lens-focal-length-comparison), and 480mm equivalent isn‚Äôt even close to the longest lens I could buy"
2025-02-24T12:34:33Z,"Also, a choice of real lenses."
2025-02-24T05:23:02Z,"Ya it‚Äôs really a hassle to carry an actual camera with you. Plus if you go to like the beach or a theme park you definitely aren‚Äôt gonna carry a real camera with you.

2025-02-24T05:37:47Z,It‚Äôs come to a point where I‚Äôll get looks whenever I take my mirrorless camera out. It‚Äôs a compact one too (Fujifilm X100VI). I purposely bought the black version so it doesn‚Äôt stand out as much and it helps but people still stare. No one looks once let alone twice if you pull out a smartphone to take a photo.
2025-02-24T07:11:22Z,They‚Äôre looking because you bought a camera with intentionally visually striking looks.
2025-02-24T05:42:18Z,Apple had a whole ad campaign about shooting high quality professional video with an iPhone . Their commercials were shot with one .

2025-02-24T04:23:53Z,"When the 15 pro added log recording that was an actual game changing feature that completely levelled up the iPhone as a video tool

I frequently use my iPhone, mounted on top of a proper video camera as a b cam shooting a basic wide shot. 

By shooting in log im able to get the two cameras to match properly. 

It really is amazing to have such a high end image coming off such a small device. 

For my money there are two key areas that Apple can improve to make the iPhone a better professional video tool

1. Either add a variable aperture lens or some sort of electronic ND. 

Bottom line is, we need to be able to shoot with a 180 degree shutter. 

The fixed f1.7 aperture lens is no good for video. An iPhone lens that could go from f1.7 to f16 or lower would be an instant upgrade for me

2. It‚Äôs such a darn pain getting files off the iPhone. 

While the Pro iPhones now get usb3 transfer speeds, in practice. This just isn‚Äôt the case. Transferring files off the iPhone, via a wire, within that weird finder view is both painful and extremely slow. 

Beyond that some open gate recording modes so we can capture the entire sensor would be welcome. 


But I suspect that to come for vloggers, they‚Äôre gonna be introducing some kind of lidar enabled subject detection autofocus mode and perhaps a tally light  on the back of the phone?


Somewhat unrelated but a great video creator tool they could add to the iPhone would be the ability to use the iPhone as a monitor. 

Some sort of way to plug your iPhone into your camera and monitor your shots through the iPhone would be a great way to sell a lot of pro maxes to video creators"

Thunderbolt on an iPhone would be cool, iPads have that.

2025-02-24T04:26:15Z,(They mean your iPhone 16 Pro)
2025-02-24T05:03:14Z,"Fix the lens flare and we‚Äôll talk, imo"
2025-02-24T05:34:43Z,How about fixing the over processing in photos instead
2025-02-24T06:41:33Z,Doesn‚Äôt it already?
2025-02-24T07:09:01Z,The best camera is the one you have with you.
2025-02-24T10:21:11Z,The best camera is the only camera you have on you. Simple.
2025-02-24T13:47:01Z,"What‚Äôs with this camera obsession? My pictures look fine. Come up with something else. 

Jesus H."
2025-02-24T03:56:19Z,Really hoping this means higher resolution video recording (8k??)
2025-02-24T03:59:11Z,"Im assuming better quality 4k. Which is what people should want. No one needs 8k from that tiny sensor. 
I would rather have bigger sensor for better dynamic range and lowlight.

This is coming from someone who owns an Android that can do 8k. I cant even share it properly. You barely can with 4k"
2025-02-24T04:10:01Z,6k would be nice so that you can crop in post and not go below 4k
2025-02-24T04:12:27Z,The iPhone is more than capable of doing 6k 60fps open gate I assume
2025-02-24T03:57:47Z,8k recording with 128gb. 5 min video?
2025-02-24T04:00:42Z,iOS will definitely choose a lower res by default like it already does for a lot of modes (most people are not using the camera system to the max). For the pros it would be great to have 8K as an option even if it means storage would be an issue. There's enough USB-C storage capabilities thanks to the new port. 1TB is cheap and easy to get.
2025-02-24T04:11:46Z,Doesn't the current ProRES format of 4K require external storage? I thought I saw a disclaimer when I enabled it one time.
2025-02-24T03:58:50Z,Why do you need to record in 8K? You have displays regularly available that you are watching 8K content on?
2025-02-24T04:12:15Z,"1. Footage filmed at 8k can be cropped and manipulated without loss of quality prior to downsampling to 4k.
2. Record archival-quality footage now for when 8k is more popular (think filmed TV shows getting re-scanned for HD)"
2025-02-24T04:09:46Z,"Resolution isn‚Äôt an issue. 

A fixed iris is the single great weakness the iPhone has as a video camera."
2025-02-24T04:00:35Z,8K by itself won‚Äôt help with anything. On that tiny of a sensor it‚Äôs all gonna be crunched through image processing anyway. Waste of storage and bandwidth at this point in time.¬†
2025-02-24T04:33:57Z,"We need 10bit 422, better low light, more dynamic range, higher quality video with less compression artifacts etc."
2025-02-24T05:03:41Z,"Apple seem clueless here.

  
Until Apple include inbuilt ND filters so you can control the shutter for video, its going to always look like cheap fast-shutter consumer video. No matter how many pixels and software tricks they want throw at it. There's a reason why video from an actual camera, controlled by someone who knows what they're doing, looks the way it looks."
2025-02-24T20:22:41Z,"It‚Äôs eerily similar to what they released in 2021. Maybe we‚Äôll see it again in 2029!

https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/04/apple-commits-430-billion-in-us-investments-over-five-years/"
2025-02-24T20:34:22Z,"from nytimes, 

&gt; ""Four years ago, a few months after Mr. Biden‚Äôs inauguration, Apple announced an ‚Äúacceleration‚Äù of its U.S. investments, pledging to spend $430 billion and add 20,000 jobs over five years. In January 2018, during Mr. Trump‚Äôs first term, the company said that its ‚Äúdirect contribution to the U.S. economy‚Äù would be $350 billion over five years and that it planned to create 20,000 jobs over that period""

apparently this is just the standard press release they roll out at the beginning of every new presidency"
2025-02-24T20:38:21Z,I wonder if they used ChatGPT or Apple Intelligence to rewrite this press release.
2025-02-24T20:28:23Z,"Quick, what's 430 after you factor in inflation!"
2025-02-24T20:20:53Z,I guess those tax breaks come in handy
2025-02-24T20:26:28Z,The generational conditioning that things made outside of the US is to be cheaper for consumers inside the US is criminal. It was only a good thing for big business to exploit lower wages in other countries.
2025-02-24T21:03:31Z,"I have not been a fan of either Trump presidency but one good thing that his arrival on the political landscape has done is make voters agree that globalization only ended up benefiting people who were already incredibly rich both at home and overseas. He hasn't done much himself to do anything about that, but through Reagan to Obama we were told it was a good thing we all need to support and vote for."
2025-02-24T20:19:21Z,"How many of those billions of dollars will land in the pockets of regular workers like the one in the thumbnail vs the same old oligarchs, I wonder?"
2025-02-24T20:28:22Z,They expect crediting 20.000 jobs.
2025-02-24T21:10:55Z,"That‚Äôs about 1,000 bodies using the technology that we were told was going to make work easier to do 20,000 jobs!"
2025-02-24T20:51:25Z,"They're primarily talking about their existing operating expenses lmfao.  They will spend $500 billion over the next four years, to make $400 billion profit."
2025-02-24T20:25:04Z,Unless they‚Äôre making iPhones in the US it doesn‚Äôt mean shit. This is just to shut Dorito Mussolini up for a while
2025-02-24T20:32:06Z,"There's a lot of infrastructure stuff that can happen in the US that would ""mean shit."" Server warehouses, support and repair work or engineering services are very real jobs and investments that can be made.

Is there a reason why you're so fixated on iPhone manufacturing?"
2025-02-24T21:10:36Z,No they wont
2025-02-24T20:32:47Z,They are expected to hire 20k jobs.
2025-02-24T21:02:08Z,I can make plans all day doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôll do them. This sounds like a way to cozy up with trump so he can claim this victory that hasn‚Äôt even happened yet. What is Apple getting in return for this propaganda is the question?
2025-02-24T21:17:49Z,Tariff exemptions most likely
2025-02-24T13:35:27Z,Time to eat some dried fruits to honor him today.
2025-02-24T13:41:16Z,"then walk around in the office later with no socks or shoes on, and then dip my feet into the commode"
2025-02-24T13:09:28Z,I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs checking Reddit

2025-02-24T15:11:34Z,"RIP to the most entertaining apple executive! 

He was the best in interviews. Fantastic public speaker."
2025-02-24T13:31:21Z,He‚Äôs dead
2025-02-24T13:11:48Z,I don‚Äôt think he really cares mate
2025-02-24T16:58:00Z,He wouldn‚Äôt care even if he was alive
2025-02-24T13:21:45Z,Doubt he still celebrates
2025-02-24T18:43:43Z,"Happy bday, jobs!"
2025-02-24T14:28:33Z,Cue idiotic comments from people on this website
2025-02-24T13:59:22Z,He was a genius. His iPhone 4 design was the most beautiful iPhone and Phones and general ever made. He changed the world in 2007.
2025-02-24T15:02:33Z,iPhone 4 was Jony Ive tho
2025-02-24T15:07:55Z,"He had at that time the lead about the design, I know. But I think that Steve Jobs had the final word."
2025-02-24T16:54:43Z,"The lead on the iPhone 4 design was Richard Howarth, who created the design in 2007, and who leads the ID team today"
2025-02-24T18:53:00Z,Steve Jobs was always very involved in the design of Apple-products. He was very close with Jony Ive. I believe Steve Jobs really had a big impact on the design.
2025-02-24T20:14:40Z,"Yes, he did. But I‚Äôm explicitly saying that every design in the ID studio has a project lead who is responsible primarily for pushing it, and Richard Howarth was iPhone 4‚Äôs ID project lead. This has been reported online. Very little is know about how the ID studio functions, but that is one of the few things we do know that‚Äôs been said"
2025-02-24T21:02:06Z,Then I agree. Misunderstood. Tired.

2025-02-24T13:17:43Z,"Steve, if you can hear me, Tim Cook gave Dictator Trump a million bucks for his ‚Äúinauguration‚Äù"
2025-02-24T15:07:06Z,Let's be real. He probably would have done the same.
2025-02-24T18:55:34Z,I don‚Äôt think dictators have a house and senate they need to go through dawg but if that fanfic makes you sleep at night ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
2025-02-24T18:56:39Z,Sure MAGA you run with that
2025-02-24T13:35:47Z,Thanks for this. I always remember Steve‚Äôs birthday¬†
2025-02-24T16:33:36Z,Why?
2025-02-24T14:28:05Z,"If he was alive, he wouldn't donate a penny to the felon."
2025-02-24T15:03:58Z,"He definitily would, because he was a businessman at end of the day, and not exactly an ethical one"
2025-02-24T18:56:18Z,TDS
2025-02-24T15:42:16Z,Fuck Steve
2025-02-24T16:55:18Z,Lmfao do you feel better? Rude as hell.¬†
2025-02-24T14:11:33Z,"He never invented anything. He was in the right place at the right time, incredibly twice, to take credit for other people's work, while he obsessed over the shape of the cases and the design of the logos. The original ideas he did have were so incredibly wrong, we don't talk about it today (no third party apps on the Mac or the iPhone. And he was a truly awful person in his personal life. When he found out he had cancer he delayed his cancer treatment by 9 months to try to cure himself with alternative medicine."
2025-02-24T13:30:40Z,Deathday
2025-02-24T13:46:08Z,Nah that's October 5th
2025-02-24T12:01:51Z,"Is this regulatory approval or is it now enabled on the iPhone by Apple in the UK? Regulatory approval was obtained in Australia several months ago, but Apple still hasn't made the feature available there."
2025-02-24T12:07:41Z,"&gt; As previously reported in January, the AirPods Pro 2 can now be used as hearing aids in the United Kingdom, having now received government approval for over-the-counter hearing aid devices.

It's enabled and available."
2025-02-24T12:22:25Z,"What a helpful thing. So many people who need a hearing aid, don‚Äôt need it bad enough. AirPods may just be available, instant increase in QoL."
2025-02-24T11:50:27Z,"Be aware that if you have severe hearing loss in either or both ears, this won't work for you. 

The UI isn't particularly clear about this and it doesn't warn you the hearing aid feature is not available if, as I did, you use a stored audiogram. I might do another test later when it's quiet.

Setup notes are here:

https://support.apple.com/en-gb/120992

_Edit: added some clarity._"
2025-02-24T14:18:52Z,"I had my grandfather, who's 100% deaf in one ear (since birth) and 90% in the other, try them out and they actually worked for him, so I guess it just depends. He actually preferred it to his hearing aid."
2025-02-24T20:48:42Z,"The feature is absolutely fantastic for listening to music with adapted profiles. But as actual hearing aids, sadly really useless compared to a proper high end model (admittedly at 10x the cost and more). 

I‚Äôm now wearing HAs and the AirPods were my first experience. But comparing them to my Phonak Spheres also made incredibly clear that Apple is only at the beginning of a journey. Looking forward to what‚Äôs available in another 5 years from now."
2025-02-24T18:07:55Z,Hope it comes to the EU soon... I would really like to try the noise protection function.¬†
2025-02-24T16:37:21Z,yeah cool but give me back my ADP
2025-02-24T19:33:23Z,So I can get AirPods by prescription now?  ü©∫
2025-02-24T13:09:34Z,"For anyone reading this with hearing issues, try out a pair of bone conduction headphones. They don‚Äôt work in all cases, but I‚Äôve had three different friends / family try them out, and they‚Äôve been life changing for two of them."
2025-02-24T15:08:40Z,"The bone conduction headphones can work for an outer or middle ear issue, and can be brilliant for those who it works for, but to my knowledge not as a hearing aid, but simply a pair of headphones."
2025-02-24T21:13:51Z,"My dad has severe hearing loss in one ear, to the point where his hearing aids don‚Äôt work any more. He‚Äôd resigned himself to just not being able to hear in that ear, as he doesn‚Äôt want to go the route of cochlear implants. I brought over a set of my bone conducting headphones to try, and he found that he could hear clearly with them for the first time in years. He now uses them along with the iPhone as a mic to take part in conversations again, and connected to the TV to hear movies etc. 

I never claimed that they were hearing aids, I only suggested that people struggling with hearing issues should give them a try. My dad was told he had inner ear damage, so these shouldn‚Äôt have worked.. but they have, and they‚Äôve significantly improved my dads life."
2025-02-24T05:09:44Z,"They will be over 50 percent hardware profit margin once they cut all the Qualcomm and Broadcomm fees for cellular, satellite and WIFI."
2025-02-24T06:13:02Z,"They could keep the same profits while dropping the iPhone price! üòÉ

(lol)"
2025-02-24T07:24:18Z,Don‚Äôt be silly.
2025-02-24T09:57:56Z,"This might sound silly but from another perspective, they may actually be able to do this and justify it if they‚Äôre able to get services profits up. 

At that point, if the service profit per user is high enough, it could be worth more to drop the iPhone price to lock in new customers that pay for services. Could be enough to offset decreased iPhone profits."
2025-02-24T12:11:59Z,"If they can make Apple One a big deal, improving TV, Music, News, and Arcade, along with iCloud+, it's a no-brainer that they could shave $50 off iPhones if people paid $200 a year for Apple One while keeping that device for 3 or 4 years (average people who don't upgrade their iPhone every year). The ecosystem is bigger than just the hardware itself now, though I think the push for paid services is still a bit nascent. There's some work to be done to make TV, Music, News, and Arcade irresistible."
2025-02-24T17:42:13Z,"It's a nice thought, but after them dumping the SE to launch the 16e it doesn't seem likely."
2025-02-24T16:55:28Z,"with upgrade cycle now being a lot longer than it used to be for a lot of people, this could actually be feasible strategy especially for lower end models......except they *just* released a very underwhelming phone for 600...so maybe Apple isn't interested in this strategy."
2025-02-24T07:32:01Z,"Yeah, right"
2025-02-24T08:35:32Z,Lmao
2025-02-24T07:35:10Z,"What‚Äôs the rundown on what the make / own vertically now? 

Modem
Chip set
What else"
2025-02-24T07:53:27Z,"&gt; What‚Äôs the rundown

I don't know, but it sounds like the rundown's really important"
2025-02-24T07:54:31Z,"I just faxed, a rundown , to my dad."
2025-02-24T08:17:02Z,Make sure to fax it to everyone on the distribution list too.
2025-02-24T12:27:39Z,It won‚Äôt be that simple. They will still need to pay a good amount of royalties for the standards essential patents that all of these companies contribute too.
2025-02-24T12:55:00Z,I‚Äôm sure a lot of the reason they purchased the Intel modem division was patents.
2025-02-24T05:09:03Z,I wonder if it means when they make newer Apple Silicon Macs that they will finally get a cellular option built into the chip.
2025-02-24T05:53:29Z,I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised honestly. Makes sense.
2025-02-24T06:08:40Z,Pleeeeeeease do this Apple
2025-02-24T08:58:36Z,"Would that mean that all MacBooks would be cellular or would they produce two variants of each chip with/without cellular, 

Or they just add it as an extra to the top chip. For example M5 pro? I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôve said this out loud. That‚Äôs definitely what they will do isn‚Äôt it."
2025-02-24T09:49:01Z,They would probably sell it as a 100‚Ç¨ addon like with ipads.
2025-02-24T06:21:11Z,That would make the MacBook Air truly portable
2025-02-24T07:33:09Z,"I‚Äôm still very happy with my M1 Pro, but if they did this I would upgrade without hesitation."
2025-02-24T13:02:39Z,What does this get you that tethering your laptop to your iPhone doesn‚Äôt?
2025-02-24T13:04:50Z,Independence from your IPhone.
2025-02-24T13:20:28Z,How often would you be on a laptop and not have your phone though? Just seems like a situation that is pretty rare in my opinion
2025-02-24T15:06:14Z,"Don‚Äôt have to worry about killing the iPhone battery by using it as a hotspot.

Anecdotally, I work with a lot of concert merchandise reps who carry around hotspots for their work computers still and i know most hate it."
2025-02-24T15:12:21Z,Fair point
2025-02-24T14:48:56Z,"You're right, but people are willing to pay more for convenience. I never owned a cellular iPad for that reason (just used my iPhone as a hotspot), but I totally get why others see having that instant, always on data connection as a big selling point (despite the additional data plan)."
2025-02-24T16:02:29Z,All consultants use it. Lenovo Thinkpad has that option.
2025-02-24T18:56:47Z,Amazing. That will be $20 a month plus taxes and fees making it $35‚Ä¶.
2025-02-24T21:18:35Z,"Battery life mainly, but it also saves you the minor inconvenience of connecting to your Hotspot each time, and then having to turn off the Hotspot(on your phone) when you‚Äôre done."
2025-02-24T05:31:46Z,Likely? That was the entire reason to develop their own modem (integrate it within the main SoC).
2025-02-24T07:17:54Z,The actual reason is that they don‚Äôt want to keep paying Qualcomm.
2025-02-24T08:38:07Z,"that too, but a discrete modem and all those chips take up a lot of extra room inside the phone

integrating it into the SoC over time will save a lot of space and reduce costs"
2025-02-24T10:58:40Z,"Integrating into SoC will cause die size increase, and considering M series chips are already at size limit this doesn‚Äôt seem possible."
2025-02-24T12:19:19Z,Care to explain the die size limit in detail?
2025-02-24T20:33:29Z,"The machines that make semi conductors can only work up to a certain size: and the closer you are to that limit, the more errors (losses) you will have. 

That is why chiplet designs have become so popular. By splitting up the chip, you can add more components without increasing die size, although it does add some complexity and latency."
2025-02-24T13:29:06Z,The primary use case is for A series. I am sure they can still use a separate modem in laptops.
2025-02-24T15:56:13Z,Apple might be waiting for the 2 nm and beyond before the integration.
2025-02-24T20:23:36Z,Power management.
2025-02-24T06:20:40Z,"Well, there‚Äôs also just getting away from third-party manufacturers which is probably an equally large reason."
2025-02-24T05:46:05Z,Exactly. What even is the point of his posts üòÇ
2025-02-24T06:02:24Z,"Those who can‚Äôt create, gossip."
2025-02-24T06:56:04Z,"Why? It will increase the size of the SoC, leading to bad yield, fewer transistors, or higher costs, unless Apple adopts chiplet/MCM designs.

What benefits can you expect from the integration?"
2025-02-24T07:35:38Z,"Lower power for the phone, lower cost for the system."
2025-02-24T07:57:35Z,"It will add like 10-15% more to the die area which is fine, in comparison to Qualcomm's 8 elite, its \~125mm2 and the X80 modem in that is \~12mm2 if you subtract that to the soc then the soc without the modem included its 113mm2. A18 and A18 Pro is 90mm2 and 105mm2. Lets say their modem is 15mm2 then using the A18/pro it would be 105mm2 and 120mm2."
2025-02-24T05:05:46Z,...waiting on you airport next gen.
2025-02-24T05:17:32Z,I doubt it. Since most of the former Apple employees who worked on the Airport &amp; Time Capsule are now in Unifi
2025-02-24T05:48:43Z,And i‚Äôm okay with that. I use ubiquiti at work and at my house and I love their products.
2025-02-24T05:59:13Z,"Ubiquiti is way better than Netgear

I don't take constructive criticism"
2025-02-24T14:56:13Z,"I don‚Äôt think anyone‚Äôs gonna debate you there. Is the equivalent of saying

‚ÄúA Porsche is better than a base Altima‚Äù"
2025-02-24T06:56:34Z,"I've found them unreliable, but I know they are popular.

I had multiple firmware bugs with their products that they refused to fix, even after I filed bug reports with them."
2025-02-24T10:38:47Z,"You're supposed to buy the newest iteration of their product, not try to fix the one you already paid for, duh

Also the AP you bought just a year ago is now EoL"
2025-02-24T16:32:33Z,"I ended up just switching to TP-Link, and their APs have been working flawlessly for me."
2025-02-24T05:25:25Z,[removed]
2025-02-24T06:09:45Z,"It can, but to what end? The router space is too crowded now that everyone has a mesh product. It‚Äôs also a high-frustration product that can tamper with brand sentiment"
2025-02-24T06:25:34Z,"It's a high frustration product that apple always has a means of making products seamless. Do I think that they will re-enter? No...probably not. Rumors persist but I am skeptical but if your argument is ""apple doesnt get involved in disjointed markets."" Well I mean obviously look at VR, Homekit, TV. Not to mention that it wouldnt be too difficult to integrate other products within the mesh router system. I could easily see a homebase/ homepod display that has a router and nodes having mesh capability but also speakers. It's not likely but it's certainly not an idea out of left field."
2025-02-24T06:28:36Z,"You may want to checkout Ubiquiti Unifi. Their Unifi Express is amazing even at WiFi 6. Unifi is waaaayyyy better than anything garbage Netgear has to offer. Fyi, most of the ex-Apple employees working on the Airport and Time Capsule are now in Unifi."
2025-02-24T06:36:19Z,I'm actually quite familiar and they make an amazing product from my understand though it does seem more intended for complete home integration as opposed to an off the shelf solution that i'd suggest the majority would prefer.
2025-02-24T06:37:10Z,"It‚Äôs not that I think they won‚Äôt as a rule, but there needs to be more upside to do so, and that upside isn‚Äôt there in a saturated router market. I imagine that Google and Amazon are getting value from customer data that Apple wouldn‚Äôt."
2025-02-24T10:47:16Z,Do you really think a near $4T company doesn't have a (backup) plan if a few employees left the company?
2025-02-24T06:09:10Z,Really wonder what reviews will say. I know it took them a lot longer than they expected and was harder than they thought according to articles. I wonder if itlll actually be as good as Qualcomm or not be as good speed/reception. If I was in the market for 16e I‚Äôd wait for reviews
2025-02-24T06:59:59Z,"People in the market for the 16e don't care about the modem being 10% worse lol

We already know it's worse, it doesn't support mmWave 5G (mostly only used by Verizon in the US)

but otherwise it will work fine.

Despite some sensationalized articles, the Intel modems also worked fine for most people."
2025-02-24T11:13:33Z,"I honestly don‚Äôt care if it gets less bandwidth. Generally the most bandwidth intensive features I‚Äôm  using in cellular mode is either FaceTime or streaming music and LTE speeds are adequate for both. 

## However‚Ä¶

I imagine many people will care about reception, and how the new antenna handles those edge cases of really really low reception. Like would a Qualcomm antenna be able to make calls while the Apple cannot? Or will calls drop more often in poor reception areas? Etc"
2025-02-24T16:41:24Z,"&gt; Like would a Qualcomm antenna be able to make calls while the Apple cannot? Or will calls drop more often in poor reception areas? Etc

They've been testing it and working on their modem for 6 years now, I would expect it's very well tested."
2025-02-24T11:46:26Z,Surely the only reason the C1 isn‚Äôt is because the A18 is also used in phones with Qualcomm modems? Presumably the second they bring it *all* in house they‚Äôll become integrated.
2025-02-24T16:16:58Z,"That's a great point! I completely forgot that they are using an older integrated chipset on this 16e model... so does that mean the 16e technically has two cellular modems in it?

Which means they are still possibly paying Qualcomm a fee for every 16e sold? Haha. Maybe it also could be an emergency fall-back with some sort of firmware update, if the hardware turns out to have some sort of major issue... Can't wait for an in-depth teardown of this thing!"
2025-02-24T05:13:27Z,"File under the ‚Äúno shit‚Äù category.

Samsung et al have benefitted from Qualcomm‚Äôs chip being all-in-one, which boosts performance and power efficiency. So the fact that Apple has been outclassing Android phones many times on battery life despite that major disadvantage goes to show they know what they‚Äôre doing, and the recent boost of 5 hours from 16 hours to 21 hours of video streaming from the 14 to 16e shows Apple can increase battery life with their modem.

I‚Äôm very excited for the future of C chips, and that they will improve no matter good, bad, or otherwise in successive generations

Edit:

Lmfao a moderator removed someone‚Äôs negative comment on Gurman.

Gurman sucks, and he has to say a bunch of obvious stuff to counter his obvious misses.¬†

2025-02-24T06:58:12Z,I'm sure they put out some false information to try to narrow down who is leaking things.
2025-02-24T05:35:43Z,So true
2025-02-24T06:10:30Z,"Oi, ‚Äôis woife‚Äôs off kilter, is she?"
2025-02-24T06:14:51Z,I appreciate you fighting back against the morons in that apple sucks subforum
2025-02-24T09:22:01Z,"iPhone 16e has a larger battery..the modem alone doesn't suck much power compared to the Qualcomm ones. Display is the largest energy user, followed by chipset itself"
2025-02-24T06:16:02Z,Any pics?
2025-02-24T05:04:00Z,Wow really!!!!üò±
2025-02-24T10:53:44Z,Another mind blowing Gurman prediction
2025-02-24T10:57:44Z,If they build it on the same nodes as the newest A chips then we‚Äôll see even more power efficiency gains
2025-02-24T15:32:30Z,"Here's hoping it mean better battery life down the road. I notice that my battery life is pretty solid at home or places where I have wifi. But if I'm out and about in new locations, I can barely check my phone and the battery level still takes a hit."
2025-02-24T06:17:22Z,Will there be any cool shit Apple will be able to do by doing this other than save money?
2025-02-24T06:56:44Z,"Sigh, yes. Also they aren‚Äôt saving money here lol"
2025-02-24T09:05:30Z,I **HOPE** this means there‚Äôs no more iPad cellular and wifi model anymore.
2025-02-24T12:15:50Z,"Knowing Apple, they will just price everything at cellular level, because it is a ‚Äúmuch magical experience now‚Äù."
2025-02-24T13:01:38Z,"Knowing Apple, they'll put the same chip in each device and deactivate areas of the chip in some models of Macs, for example, to keep their precious pricing ladder. You want cell connectivity? No problem, you need this model (with the chip turned on)."
2025-02-24T11:40:51Z,Welcome back Google Pixel camera module
2025-02-24T16:48:08Z,Yeah but the pixels looks waaay better üíÄ
2025-02-24T17:47:34Z,"It looks more like the dynamic island than like Google‚Äôs design.

Exact same placement and all"
2025-02-24T17:50:10Z,"Yeah, but it‚Äôs close enough to be reminiscent of it, and it‚Äôs funny because Google is apparently killing that design this year"
2025-02-24T13:41:35Z,"Reminds me of the Nexus 6P camera ‚Äúfiasco‚Äù. People were going crazy saying it was the ugliest thing they‚Äôve ever seen. Others were saying they didn‚Äôt mind. It was controversial at the time.

2025-02-24T11:11:36Z,I remember that the ‚Äúhuge camera bump‚Äù of the iPhone 11 Pro (Max) got leaked and everyone went berserk. Then Apple unveiled the actual iPhone and everyone was like ‚Äúah yeah that‚Äôs fine‚Äù
2025-02-24T11:31:36Z,"Same with Watch Ultra. Render looked absolutely ass but it turned out fine, as usual."
2025-02-24T12:19:36Z,It's almost as if apple has some of the worlds best product designers and somehow those aren't matched by internet randos with some 3d skills.
2025-02-24T14:17:39Z,I guess they hired them after the current camera bump design?
2025-02-24T16:26:33Z,ü§°
2025-02-24T15:22:28Z,"Has there been any single mainline Apple product in the last decade that has been an actual design flop? The closest thing I can think of is the AirPod Max case. Otherwise, everything ranges from good to forgettable. They haven‚Äôt released anything daring enough to be considered awful or great since the trashcan Mac Pro in 2013."
2025-02-24T15:56:08Z,"I can‚Äôt think of any main products but there have definitely been a few accessories that were poorly designed.

The Apple battery cases with the bump were pretty panned when they released, even revisiting them the design is still horrible. You also have the Apple Pencil with its male connector and the Magic Mouse but they‚Äôre more of a functional annoyance."
2025-02-24T17:42:38Z,"Even the AirPod max are way more popular than I ever thought they‚Äôd be. Very single airport, bus and train is full of people wearing them or wearing a rip off."
2025-02-24T15:24:54Z,Wasn't this the same with the notch and pill? It seems any design changes people will not like and then they're fine with it.
2025-02-24T12:08:21Z,Happens every year!
2025-02-24T16:44:17Z,"I mean let‚Äôs be honest, the tri-camera setup is still ugly af"
2025-02-24T12:50:55Z,"If they fix the rocking back and forward when it's on a desk, that is all i care about. It's so annoying."
2025-02-24T20:16:45Z,Who really cares?
2025-02-24T20:41:50Z,"I do, wanna fight about it?"
2025-02-24T20:44:01Z,"Let‚Äôs go‚Ä¶ If the biggest problem in your life is a tiny camera bump, I‚Äôd say you‚Äôre doing pretty well"
2025-02-24T11:46:47Z,I‚Äôm convinced the only reason the camera bump changes from year to year is to sell more cases.
2025-02-24T13:12:32Z,"It's so that everyone will know you have ""The Best iPhone we've ever made**‚Ñ¢ ""**"
2025-02-24T14:41:34Z,They also move the buttons a little every year
2025-02-24T17:25:36Z,People whine when the design doesn‚Äôt change. People whine when the design changes. Y‚Äôall are pretty insufferable lmfao
2025-02-24T17:38:21Z,Does it really count as a design change when the chassis is the exact same but the camera bump is a millimeter bigger and the volume rocker got pushed a millimeter down?
2025-02-24T20:10:25Z,A design millichange.
2025-02-24T13:51:32Z,"Well, larger sensors means shallower depth of field and better low light capabilities ie photos look more professional and video appears more cinematic. But this means larger lenses to focus the light on the sensor. Means bigger camera bump."
2025-02-24T18:09:58Z,"I love this take. 

Mostly because its for people with enough disposable income to buy a new phone each year being annoyed they can‚Äôt reuse their case"
2025-02-24T18:23:49Z,I mean who can afford to get a new phone every year but somehow draw the line at buying a new case? I mean you can get great clear cases on amazing for like $7.
2025-02-24T19:20:36Z,"Yeah, if your case is outliving your phone then you‚Äôre doing it wrong"
2025-02-24T15:45:13Z,"This isn‚Äôt a rhetorical question, have they ever kept designs consistent enough that you could keep a case when moving to the next iPhone?

I don‚Äôt remember ever doing that, but I haven‚Äôt bought every iPhone"
2025-02-24T15:57:12Z,I think this was generally doable during the #S era
2025-02-24T16:28:27Z,"* iphone 3G and 3GS

* iphone 4 and 4s

* iphone 5 and 5s and SE 1st gen

* iphone 6 and 6s

* *iphone 7 and iphone 8 (not sure about this one)*

* iphone x and xs (camera bump half a mm larger on the XS but most cases still were fine)

* iphone se 2nd and se 3rd gen

* iphone 13 and iphone 14

so basically last time, it was in 2022 with the iPhone 14"
2025-02-24T18:59:15Z,"I didn‚Äôt realize that the 13 and 14 were the same! 

Would certainly be nice if they did this every now and than again.."
2025-02-24T19:57:48Z,"The 13 and 14 are a mixed bag. Most 14 cases will fit on a 13 with a slightly looser fit around the camera bump, and while a good number of 13 cases were updated to have larger camera holes to fit the 14, cases for the 13 that have tighter tolerances around the camera bump [will not fit](https://cdn.pickr.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iphone-14-in-iphone-13-case.jpg) the 14. Apple's cases for the 13 don't fit the 14 because of this.

The 15 is also a weird instance, since some case makers eventually just made the same case for the 13, 14, and 15, but YMMV. To a similar extent, there exist cases that fit for the 6, 6s, 7, 8, SE 2, and SE 3, with camera cutouts large enough to support all 6 phones and the bottom being cut out to support the headphone jack. The XR and 11 are mostly the same dimensionally, so most 11 cases can actually go on the XR, albeit with a lot of exposed glass."
2025-02-24T12:11:09Z,"Is this suggesting that the body of the 17 Pro will feature metal wrapping around the back, with a glass panel (in red) for connectivity? That would be a super interesting design and a nice departure from the glass-sandwich, which has become a bit stale imo."
2025-02-24T11:52:49Z,It's fine but the 17's alleged design sticks out like a sore thumb in that line-up. It's the only one without a horizontal bar.
2025-02-24T12:41:37Z,"The lenses have to stay in that position because of the spatial video capabilities, I agree though."
2025-02-24T14:25:47Z,Insane dedication to a feature 99.9% of people won‚Äôt experience
2025-02-24T17:49:28Z,"Not this year. But in less than 10 years, we will be happy to look back at those videos.."
2025-02-24T12:58:08Z,Just hold it horizontally to make the bar vertical /s
2025-02-24T14:08:50Z,"yeah so it'll look boring and ppl will buy the Pros/Air because they look newer

Apple's entire product strategy is to make the more affordable products (that they still need to have because a decent portion of the customer base has a hard line for budget) look boring so that as many people as possible get nudged to the higher tier models"
2025-02-24T14:22:03Z,That design just does not make any sense.
2025-02-24T18:27:19Z,Looks horrible the only looks decent is the vertical camera position
2025-02-24T13:29:17Z,"What bothers me is that the lenses still stick out. If it was flush, the phone won‚Äôt rock anymore"
2025-02-24T11:09:33Z,"In before people say 'Thanks, I hate it.' CAD renderings and mockups based on leaks often don't capture how the real product will look like in person."
2025-02-24T11:13:55Z,"I mean, if there‚Äôs a good reason that the bump extends all the way across like something to improve the camera greatly then that‚Äôs fine, but if it‚Äôs purely aesthetic then that‚Äôs stupid.

I‚Äôm all for functional design changes if they make sense. Hopefully the camera bump acts the same as a widget so to speak, and now that it‚Äôs been enlarged it has a little more functionality than before."
2025-02-24T15:08:22Z,"the bump will increase in size until the entire back is flat again, going full circle"
2025-02-24T11:24:09Z,Maybe most of the phones motherboard is pushed up inside the new bumps and the rest is just screen and battery.
2025-02-24T17:48:46Z,"It looks exactly like the dynamic island, but on the back."
2025-02-24T13:27:49Z,Just like the Mac &amp; iPad lineup the iPhone lineup is becoming inconsistent.
2025-02-24T14:29:39Z,"They finally fixed the ass ugly square module with the 16, and now they‚Äôre gonna come out with something even uglier"
2025-02-24T11:51:34Z,Talk about ‚ú®consistent design language ‚ú®
2025-02-24T11:08:37Z,"&gt;The leaker Majin Bu has had some hits in the past, but some of his information has been wrong, including a rumor about an iPad 11 being imminent in 2023. What's different in this particular case is that Weibo-based leakers Fixed Focus Digital, Ice Universe, and Digital Chat Station have all backed the accuracy of the CAD image, based on their own information from Apple's supply chain in China. ""The appearance is basically like this,"" commented Digital Chat Station in reference to the image. It might just be time to get used to this new look."
2025-02-24T11:31:51Z,So the 17 air is more like an enlarged 16e as opposed to an enlarged 17? Who is going to want to sacrifice camera quality for a slightly larger screen?
2025-02-24T12:20:00Z,[deleted]
2025-02-24T12:30:57Z,"Oddly gender specific reply, but okay."
2025-02-24T15:20:32Z,Big strong men like you?
2025-02-24T12:08:49Z,These all look weird. Then again so did the current design sketches at first. Leave it to Apple to deliver a polished product.
2025-02-24T12:41:46Z,"Okay, pulling the plug on the 16 Pro, this bump is insane"
2025-02-24T12:51:50Z,They are unofficial leaks... i would not base anything on them.
2025-02-24T13:23:13Z,"Oh, my friend, how you need to learn the ways of the Apple. These are tutti-fruitti, phoney-baloney, plastic banana, good time, rock-n-roll Apple PR ‚Äúleaks‚Äù to build hype."
2025-02-24T16:12:07Z,"Currently using the 16 Pro Max which already looks pretty ridiculous. We‚Äôve far exceeded the usage case for the general consumer now. There‚Äôs no reason to keep making the camera array larger if it‚Äôs going to detract from the form of the rest of the phone.

At this point I think it‚Äôs just a way for Apple to make each model differentiable and make a token improvement over last year without properly innovating."
2025-02-24T11:58:14Z,"If the red means glass, why the back of iPhone 17 &amp; 17 Air doesn‚Äôt have red back‚Ä¶ can‚Äôt be metal back, right?"
2025-02-24T12:56:19Z,"I‚Äôm assuming they only did the red on the 17 pro due to the fact that it had a different back. Otherwise, I would assume that it‚Äôs likely all glass. 

We‚Äôve also heard from FPT (take what they say with a grain of salt though) that the entire pro phone looks like a unibody. Which might point to Apple having integrated the glass with the aluminum to make them look nearly identical so you can‚Äôt even tell. Which I think would be a really cool design choice!"
2025-02-24T14:13:56Z,Similar to how it is on the MacBooks touchpad.
2025-02-24T12:21:14Z,What the actual fuck is Apple doing
2025-02-24T14:09:14Z,"Thriving. People have been bashing 
the initial leaks for years now and yet sales go up and up"
2025-02-24T18:48:10Z,Yea that's cool but I've been off the leaks since like 2022 so i genuinely have no idea wth is going on
2025-02-24T12:37:33Z,"Dylan G, is that you?!

Jk‚Ä¶ in all seriousness I said the same thing. Time will tell!"
2025-02-24T12:25:10Z,"I don‚Äôt think this is going to be 100% accurate however I‚Äôd like to use the opportunity to complain about the bump and want it to go. Flush out the back for more battery if possible. If not, still flush is out please."
2025-02-24T14:10:09Z,"Jeez.. those pro‚Äôs are ugly, such a weird dead space in between the lenses and flash. So not thought out. This feels like a bad render job made from leaks. 

Maybe they should have kept Jony Ive onboard. 

The Air tho, super sexy."
2025-02-24T15:08:56Z,Something I really like about the 16e is the simplicity on just one camera lens. This is just a mess.
2025-02-24T12:02:20Z,There is nothing ‚Äûrevealed‚Äú it‚Äôs an image from weibo
2025-02-24T12:46:02Z,"I know it will look better in real life, like always, but... this looks even worse than usual."
2025-02-24T13:10:37Z,Oh no‚Ä¶
2025-02-24T15:07:43Z,"If this is real, then maybe MagSafe is becoming a pro-only feature"
2025-02-24T15:16:45Z,Does the Pro look slightly smaller than the regular 17? Or would that be something not really accurate in a render.
2025-02-24T17:01:45Z,What does this lebensbumping actually get you though? The sensor + optics getting taller is one thing but are they going to make use of that extra z height?
2025-02-24T20:06:19Z,Just make the whole phone as thick as the camera!
2025-02-24T20:21:12Z,What is this? A game of dominos?
2025-02-24T11:53:27Z,"I still don't get it. Why slim phones? Are they warming us up for when future pro maxes(pro maxii?) folds?

Even Samsung and some Chinese companies are into it."
2025-02-24T14:14:49Z,It‚Äôs a new trend will compete with Galaxy Edge
2025-02-24T15:50:53Z,Absolutely disgusting
2025-02-24T12:44:36Z,"I‚Äôve had every tip of the line iPhone since the 4. Currently rock a 1tb 16 pro max.

I‚Äôm gonna probably get the top 17 pro max but I‚Äôm gonna say it:

This looks like one of those android phones."
2025-02-24T12:57:50Z,"They need to fix the lens flare first, it‚Äôs been prominent for a few generations."
2025-02-24T13:11:18Z,Looks like Apple is in for a major innovation ‚Äúever‚Äù
2025-02-24T13:53:08Z,Dammit! I was really hoping the 17 base model (the one I'm going to buy) would have the horizontal camera well
2025-02-24T12:08:33Z,What the hell with all those cameras. I just want a simple phone and a decent camera at cheaper price. Jeez why do people need that ? 48mp camera so they can sell more icloud storage‚Ä¶ quality is now good enough for 98% of the situations.
