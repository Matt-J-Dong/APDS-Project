2025-02-23T17:26:49Z,I built an iOS app for checking gas &amp; EV charging prices via CarPlay ‚Äì OctaneBuddy
2025-02-23T17:26:49Z,"Hey r/apple,

I wanted a way to check gas prices while driving via CarPlay, but I was surprised that no app offered this. Since I drive a car that requires premium and a full tank is over 50L, even saving a few cents per litre adds up quickly. So, I decided to dive into iOS development and build my own solution‚ÄîOctaneBuddy (https://apps.apple.com/us/app/octanebuddy/id6738063165).

What started as a personal project is now on the App Store (**with no ads, no data collection, and no subscription**‚ÄîI originally built it just for myself). Since launching, I‚Äôve been adding features based on user feedback, including:

‚úÖ Gas price support for the **US, Canada, UK, and now Germany**! üá©üá™ (With **Australia &amp; Austria** coming soon)

‚úÖ EV charging station support (mostly tested in the US &amp; Canada, but should work worldwide!)

‚úÖ Support for **Diesel**, **E85**, and more fuel types

I‚Äôm planning to work on a widget next and will also be refining the UI based on feedback. If you install the app, I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts! There‚Äôs a ‚ÄúContact me‚Äù button in the app for direct feedback, and if you spot any bugs, I‚Äôll fix them ASAP.

Let me know if you‚Äôd like to TestFlight beta releases before they go live! This is my first ever app and I‚Äôm new to Swift so bear with me :) I‚Äôd like to make more apps so if you have ideas for a ‚Äúsimple‚Äù app that doesn‚Äôt exist or isn‚Äôt done well and would benefit many, lmk!

Thanks, and happy driving! üöó‚õΩ‚ö°

Edit: if you'd like to TestFlight, I'd be happy to add you! Please hit the ""contact me"" button in the app or send an email to [sid@siddharthnatamai.com](mailto:sid@siddharthnatamai.com) so I can add your email to the TestFlight group. Thank you!!

Edit 2: Also gonna seriously look into CloudKit and make a proof of concept app where users can snap a pic of the gas station pump and feed prices into a database for other users to view. Maybe it can be turned into a mini game of sorts :)

Edit 3: Widgets and initial install/launch bug fixed and on the way to TestFlight users and App Store soon (hopefully by tomorrow). This will be version 1.5.5"

2025-02-23T12:21:44Z,"I made an app to help you tackle habits more easily through Habit Stacking (NO Ads, Privacy Focused)"
2025-02-23T12:21:44Z,"Hello everyone! I‚Äôd like to share a bit of a story around how I launched my very first iOS app. At the middle of last year, I was obsessed with productivity systems and scrolling productivity subreddits in the hopes that I would finally find something that would fix my life. This is when I stumbled on the concept of habit stacking - the idea of linking new habits to existing ones. I started small: after pouring my morning coffee, I would write the three tasks I needed to get done for the day. After brushing my teeth, I would meditate for five minutes.

I needed a way to keep track of the growing sequential habits but none of the apps I found on the Appstore really captured the way how habits naturally flowed together - so I spent my weekends and hours after work since developing Chayn using SwiftUI. It was a steep learning curve but finally ‚Äúfinishing‚Äù (if there is any such thing) and hitting publish made it all worth it. It‚Äôs [now available to download on the app store.](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/chayn-stack-habits/id6741157498)

**Key Features:**

* Ability to stack habits (both in sequence and in parallel)
* Track your moods
* Keep track of total time spent on habits + streaks
* Customise each habit and habit stack to your liking
* Make your habits as detailed or as simple as you want

Feel free to reach out with any requests for new features and/or feedback that you might have on the app if you decide to try it out. Have a great rest of your day!"

Did a return - they didnt even ask for the original back - thats how disposable they are / known problem is.  Went to Apple site and it had been pulled.

Got the new one - a few weeks - same fault.  Just logged second return .. again no need to send back and Apple are selling again .. for ¬£140 you would expect better... best avoided."

2025-02-22T12:17:49Z,"&gt;Apple just made a huge move, but most people don‚Äôt realize it yet. While everyone‚Äôs focused on the new iPhone 16e, the real story is the C1 modem. The Apple C1 is the first in-house modem chip Apple has ever created. This shift could reshape how Apple devices connect to the world, much like Apple Silicon did for performance.

&gt;I got an exclusive behind-the-scenes tour of Apple‚Äôs modem testing labs, guided by some of the company‚Äôs top engineers. In this video, I‚Äôll break down how the C1 modem works, why it matters, and what it means for the future of Apple‚Äôs ecosystem. From improved power efficiency and seamless A18 processor integration to potential future advancements like millimeter-wave 5G, the C1 is Apple‚Äôs first step in total modem independence.

2025-02-23T14:15:53Z,"Hi everyone! I‚Äôm a software developer who has been caring for pets for over 12 years, helping over 30 cats and dogs. While it‚Äôs been incredibly rewarding, staying on top of everything‚Äîvaccinations, medications, new symptoms, and emerging problems‚Äîhas always been a challenge. Life gets busy, and things can slip through the cracks, sometimes leading to preventable health issues.

Over the years, I searched for a tool that could help me log almost everything about my pets and provide actionable insights to make better care decisions‚Äîbut I couldn‚Äôt find one that fully met my needs.

üåç **Traveller-Friendly:**

2025-02-23T16:09:28Z,"Hello Guys!

I released an expense tracker app called [Finma](https://finma.money) last week. There are 1000s of expense tracker apps, so why did I make another one? I'll explain in a few points why I made it and what differentiates it from others: 

**Why did I build this?**  
\- I live in India and wanted an app that could track all my bank accounts and credit cards in one place, *automatically*!  
\- Automatic tracking was the key here, I'm lazy and hate manual expense entries.  
\- Started building Finma around 2 years ago, there were 0 apps that supported auto-expense tracking for credit cards and bank accounts in India on iOS.

**How does auto-expense tracking work?**  
\- Finma directly connects to your email, searches for transaction alerts and statements sent by your bank and automatically creates transactions entries.  
\- A rules features allows you to create keyword based rules and auto-tag transaction based on your usage.  
\- To ensure 100% accuracy, I have built-in support for most Indian banks. Post launch, thanks to users I'm slowing adding custom PDF parsing support for more International banks.

**Where does AI come in the picture?**  
\- For statements that I haven't added custom support, I use OpenAI or Google Gemini to extract transactions from PDFs.  
\- Automatic category suggestions  
\- Some other areas where AI is used is automatic transaction extraction from bank email alerts, helping with regex, etc.

**Privacy**  
\- Built with privacy in mind, I do not store any financial data on any server. All user data is stored locally on-device.  
\- I try my best to process PDFs and emails locally.  
\- Any data that does get sent over to AI services is anonymous and is not linked to the user.

**Future Plans**  
\- Working on adding Plaid/Teller and GoCardless support for direct bank integration. 

\---

**Giveaway:**  
I'm giving away 4 promo codes for 1 year subscription worth a total of $100 ($25/yr sub). All you got to do is check out the app and give me some feedback -- both good and especially bad feedback are appreciated as I really want to fix the pain points first.

2025-02-23T09:38:56Z,I've built an app that translates your Apple Watch health data!
2025-02-23T09:38:56Z,"Hey everyone!

Meet Livity! It's a health tracker that uses your Apple Watch data to show you stuff like sleep patterns, body recovery, and how hard you're pushing yourself during the day.

The big thing for me was privacy - I'm tired of apps that want to upload everything to their servers. This one does everything right on your phone. No accounts, no cloud stuff, just your data staying on your device where it belongs.

Main features:

\* Sleep tracking &amp; analysis  
\* Recovery tracking  
\* Daily strain monitoring  
\* Battery-style energy level  
\* Stress alerts when you need to take a breather

There is our Reddit community r/LivityApp where everyone can join and suggest new features / complain about the bugs (I always do my best to fix those, as Livity just became my full-time job!)

If you're into health tracking but don't want your data floating around somewhere, check it out:¬†  
[https://apps.apple.com/us/app/livity-sleep-health-tracker/id6498938838](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/livity-sleep-health-tracker/id6498938838)

Most of you hate paid apps so I will go straight to the point.  
The first overview screen is free for everyone where you can take a quick look at your day stats.   
More detailed data is behind the paywall.¬†

The main selling subscription is yearly which costs around 30$, which is around 2.5$ per month."

I'm thinking that the biggest consideration for someone like myself is the chip, the 16e has the latest, which seems to me will last longer/give better performance over 4-5yrs. 

Anything else I should consider? I lean 16e."

Is there a way we can transfer this icloud plan / access or whatever to the mothers existing account? So she pays for it monthly and can access it still? She just wants to keep everything intact and be able to access the memories etc.

Thank you."

2025-02-24T21:07:46Z,"So sorry for your and her/his loss. 

If you have access to her emails, you could reset her password so you know it and never be locked out. 

Can test resetting on your own device. 

You could also look to see if her pictures are downloaded onto her devices and could cancel the iCloud if it is indeed downloaded. The only concern that the phone will be the only access to it. Phones will sometimes fail. Motherboard broke. Storage. Battery swell etc. not common but it happens. Also it will get outdated in a few years due to later iOS and such.  

Could look to putting her photos and videos on another device so it lives forever."

2025-02-24T15:27:13Z,"For whatever reason, Steam is programmed to do that: once launched, it bounces in the Dock, disappears, then comes back again. If it doesn‚Äôt come back again, then your macOS version is most likely unsupported by Steam. I think Steam requires macOS 10.14 or 10.15 at minimum. What version of macOS are you using?"
2025-02-24T11:43:35Z,"I'm deciding between an IPhone 16/15 Pro. 

My pick would go to the 15 Pro (due to things like the better camera's, screen and higher refresh rate for example) but I've been reading a lot of complains regarding it's battery life. Are these still warranted? I'm hoping to have this one last a couple of years so having some headroom isn't a luxury... 

If the battery really is such a big difference that might be enough to make me opt for the 16."
2025-02-24T15:29:44Z,"Complaints about phones and battery life are almost as old as time. If you fully charge your phone, and then play Death Stranding on it for a few hours, the battery is going to turn to mush.

That said, the 15 Pro is no longer on sale, so any you see are either refurbished or used."

Unfolded it will probably be the same size as a current iPhone, so it'd probably be more accurate to say that you have the option to _halve_ your screen size at a moment's notice. Which is still valuable."
2025-02-24T18:30:30Z,"We don't know if it's gonna be a Fold type (folds open into an iPad Mini size) or a Flip (the one you mention a normal phone that folds in half).

2025-02-24T18:48:25Z,"The ideal case would be having an iPhone and iPad Mini in one device.

2025-02-24T19:02:25Z,"I've upgraded to a 12 but still use my 7 as a backup phone and shit runs smooth as hell, just poor battery life"
2025-02-24T17:43:26Z,"My 13 Pro Max is still great. Battery health is still in the high 80s and I don‚Äôt plan on upgrading anytime soon. The only thing I wish I had was USB C, but that‚Äôs not worth $1000 when this phone is fully paid off and works like new"
2025-02-24T18:06:55Z,"I‚Äôm with you on this. Still on my 13 pro bought on launch. So far, seeing the new releases, I just miss the usb c. My entire ecosystem is running on usb c."
2025-02-24T17:16:24Z,Was gonna buy the 16e until they butchered the price. Bought a 13 pro instead and I'm loving it
2025-02-24T18:22:52Z,"I just upgraded from the 13 pro to the 16 pro and honestly I can hardly tell the difference. Other than the camera, it‚Äôs
The same."
2025-02-24T17:18:37Z,"11 Pro Max says chill, son"
2025-02-24T18:06:13Z,"Just changed the battery on my 11 pro max, works like a brand new phone again."
2025-02-24T18:18:26Z,That's only a 3 year old pro phone? Just replace the battery and it'll last another 4+ years.
2025-02-24T17:17:28Z,All I want is a bigger camera bump
2025-02-24T18:16:54Z,"I want a camera bump at least as deep as the phone is tall, so I can use my iPhone as a set square"
2025-02-24T18:52:18Z,"I'd legitimately buy an iPhone with a bigger and better camera sensor and lens. Like a 1"" or micro 4/3 sensor. 

Yes it would be bulkier, but having something closer in performance to a dedicated camera but with much better HDR capabilities and always synced to my cloud photo library would be great."
2025-02-24T17:28:57Z,I think a flip iPhone would be very popular among young women.
2025-02-24T18:16:27Z,This is my favorite prediction so far
2025-02-24T19:35:27Z,Are folding phones in demand or something?  I don‚Äôt think I want my phone to fold.
2025-02-24T17:32:25Z,"I really hope that we get a clamshell foldable and it is a pro iPhone. It‚Äôs probably the only type of foldable I would be interested in. The weird aspect ratio tablet foldable just does not intrigue me at all. Even then, I probably wouldn‚Äôt buy any type of foldable if I have to sacrifice a lot of power battery life or camera quality."
2025-02-24T17:52:35Z,"There‚Äôs no time in the future I‚Äôll ever look at a folding phone and think ‚Äúoh boy, I want that‚Äù. 

It‚Äôs a solution where no problem exists. Not only that, it also adds a ton of its own problems. It‚Äôs like evolving backwards."
2025-02-24T17:16:31Z,I wonder if it‚Äôs gonna be popular Samsung doesn‚Äôt sell -that- many and I feel it would be kind of annoying having to ‚Äúopen‚Äù my phone and be hyper fixated on that center fold..
2025-02-24T17:35:33Z,"We all know once Apple does something it gains traction and companies imitate it. It has happened with almost everything and will happen with this too. Plug/brick in box, notch, wired earbuds in box, list goes on and on‚Ä¶"
2025-02-24T17:55:59Z,"What do you mean by companies imitate it in this case?

Apple is like the last to do a screen like this"
2025-02-24T17:37:07Z,"Give us a smaller phone, another mini please! Think different."
2025-02-24T18:02:49Z,A mini phone with pro specs updated every 3 years would be good by me
2025-02-24T18:09:30Z,They tried and it didn‚Äôt sell
2025-02-24T19:08:06Z,Times have changed with the SE removal. There‚Äôs a market for smaller but still powerful phones
2025-02-24T17:06:32Z,Sweet! That will be an easy pass.
2025-02-24T18:24:26Z,Why does this sub hate foldable phones so much? It‚Äôs literally just more screen estate. I‚Äôd buy one in a heartbeat.
2025-02-24T18:29:14Z,"They also hated big phones, and said 3.5 inches was perfect and phablets were a fad... Now they carry 7 inch phones.

Same will happen with foldables."
2025-02-24T18:50:35Z,I still hate big phones homie. I will use my 12 mini until it dies.
2025-02-24T20:38:26Z,"I also hate big phones and would prefer foldables that go from standard phone to a smaller phone, not the other way around of big phone unfolding into a tablet."
2025-02-24T18:51:10Z,It‚Äôs almost as if there are different people with different needs here.
2025-02-24T19:11:39Z,I‚Äôve never understood the fascination with foldable iPhones
2025-02-24T19:49:11Z,I don‚Äôt want a folding phone. They will not last.
2025-02-24T17:05:46Z,"Please be a flip phone half size foldable, not a giant square."
2025-02-24T17:18:57Z,"This is all I‚Äôve wanted for awhile. I just want what I already have, but folds in half so it fits better in pockets. Otherwise my 15 pro is fine."
2025-02-24T17:26:46Z,I'll take the giant square
2025-02-24T18:21:35Z,"Same. My preference is an iPhone I can fold out into an ‚ÄúiPad mini‚Äù on demand, rather than a flip iPhone I need to unflip every time I want to use it"
2025-02-24T18:18:37Z,"Knowing Apple, they‚Äôre definitely going to make the more expensive one first. Giant square coming near you."
2025-02-24T17:04:05Z,But y tho?
2025-02-24T17:07:56Z,To record TikTok videos obviously
2025-02-24T17:08:17Z,Because they struggle with any actual innovation.
2025-02-24T17:46:21Z,"The innovation is in the details‚Ä¶ obviously I haven‚Äôt seen  this imaginary product, but I would imagine that if and when it comes out, Apple will have solved the crease issue.

I don‚Äôt understand why people think the word innovate means ‚Äúbrand new idea that nobody has thought of.‚Äù It **can** mean that, but it can also just be about specific design of an existing product."
2025-02-24T17:26:16Z,Because nothing drives sales like a change in form factor.
2025-02-24T17:10:24Z,"I just want a refreshed iPhone 13 mini or SE 3 with the A18, 8 GB RAM, 128 GB storage, and an OLED display that doesn‚Äôt cost more than $500. Is that too much to ask for?"
2025-02-24T18:08:00Z,"You want the best smartphone chip in the world, produced using the most advanced chip fabrication process in the world, with an OLED display, for under $500. Of course that‚Äôs too much to ask for."
2025-02-24T18:48:47Z,I'd pay iPhone Pro Max prices for a new mini.
2025-02-24T17:33:37Z,"I‚Äôll settle for a Mini refresh with Dynamic Island, a 1000nit display, and the 16e‚Äôs 48mp camera."
2025-02-24T17:19:38Z,Not gonna lie foldable phone seems like a gimmick that very few people want/need
2025-02-24T19:04:23Z,Sales increasing every year from what I remember. Not something I‚Äôm personally interested in but obviously a growing market with a willingness to pay a premium.
2025-02-24T17:18:05Z,Could be wrong but I believe they will treat this as a new product category outside of iPhone or iPad branding
2025-02-24T18:53:35Z,BiPhone or TriPhone if they go with a 3 fold display.
2025-02-24T17:32:25Z,So glad I got the 16 Pro Max. Now I can wait it out and have my pick once all these new Apple made chips and iPhone design changes get sorted out ü•Ç
2025-02-24T17:50:52Z,I think most people don‚Äôt like foldable smartphones until Apple release their first model‚Ä¶
2025-02-24T18:09:07Z,"I can only hope that Apple continues to make Pro phones that don‚Äôt fold. Plenty of people will still want the best processor, best camera system, etc. without the folding gimmick, so I hope that continues to be an option."
2025-02-24T18:24:51Z,Ill believe it when i see it
2025-02-24T18:33:57Z,"They keep pushing it back, and for good reason.

When foldables first came out, they were shit. The crease was visible and dust could get in under it.

I've looked at new foldables from Samsung and Honor (Huawei). The crease is still visible, but a little less so. The actual crease looks ten times better these days, and the dust protection is better. I almost think it's time for foldables, though I still don't like the form factor. They do have their uses. I know Apple won't go for it until it's ready, and it will probably be ready by September 2026. Maybe this year, maybe not."
2025-02-24T21:14:08Z,What a meaningless article. I just read the same information written different words again and again and again.
2025-02-24T18:49:53Z,"Unpopular opinion, but foldable phones are just a pointless gimmick, and honestly, smartphones have already peaked in design."
2025-02-24T18:12:55Z,This would be the first new iPhone I ever buy on release day
2025-02-24T18:23:32Z,Folding phones costs twice as much (at least) and last half as long (at best) so they're too enticing for Apple to leave alone forever
2025-02-24T19:17:12Z,All I want is a better battery
2025-02-24T14:48:26Z,"Jony is a great designer and artist, but great designers and artists need¬†***editors.***  
  
**Steve was Jony's editor.**¬†Once Steve was gone, Ive lost that critical editor. Cook gave Jony CEO-level reign per Steve's wishes,¬†*and Ive went rampantly in the wrong direction*, putting art and form over functionality on products that decidedly had to be usable.  
  
A MacBook Pro isn't JUST modern art,¬†**it needs to be a workhorse for 5-8 years**, not just look pretty on a shelf like some overpriced figurine you buy at an art gallery.  
  
Hence, MacBook Pro butterfly keyboards that looked gorgeous but didn't feel great to type on, and wouldn't work if a speck of anything got into them. Removal of usable features like HDMI ports, SD card slots and MagSafe? Thinness for no good reason at the expense of features or more battery life?  
  
I'm happy Apple is building products that are more usable than in the Ive era.¬†**Especially**¬†on their pro lines."
2025-02-24T15:27:23Z,"I want my MacBook Pro thick, with plenty of battery, with some actual ports, and some damn cooling. I‚Äôd say my current M1 Pro MBP satisfies most of that and I‚Äôm still very happy with it."
2025-02-24T15:55:30Z,"My M1 Pro battery is almost at 80% capacity after nearly 4 years. I see no reason to upgrade to newer models, just going to swap out batteries and push for another 4 years. Best laptop I‚Äôve ever owned. I was so excited when they brought back MagSafe and the SD card reader."
2025-02-24T16:08:58Z,"I have an affection for my 16"" M1 pro that I haven't felt for a computer since my commodore 64."
2025-02-24T16:17:18Z,It truly felt like a ‚Äúsorry about that‚Äù moment from Apple after the previous generation of form over function MBP‚Äôs. It‚Äôs aging like wine as well. I only feel the squeeze from having 16GB RAM when using Lightroom at times.
2025-02-24T17:02:06Z,"Have one for work, and it has easily been the longest I've used a machine without getting too frustrated by the limitations and wanting to upgrade. Our IT has a 4-year replacement cycle so I probably could ask for an upgrade soon, but I don't really see the point."
2025-02-24T18:40:04Z,"I just upgraded to a M3 Air after my faithful Pro stopped being capable of running programs *after 15 years*. Lack of MagSafe is one of the reasons I put off getting a new computer for so long.

(While I need the SD card reader, I couldn‚Äôt justify a $500 price premium for just that when an Anker hub is $30 and also gives me the HDMI port and two USB-A ports as well.)"
2025-02-24T16:52:31Z,"And this is the dilemma of varying opinions. The current MacBook Pro is as thick/heavy as I‚Äôm willing to go. I personally wouldn‚Äôt want any added thickness/weight, even if it‚Äôs in the name of better battery or cooling. A laptop should be portable by definition; any heavier and we‚Äôll be getting into gaming laptop territory (which I don‚Äôt define as portable).

For me, I‚Äôd rather Apple focus on improving what they have while keeping the same footprint. Any thinner and they‚Äôre wasting potential, but any thicker and it‚Äôs inconvenient to carry around."
2025-02-24T21:44:28Z,I‚Äôd like them to make a thinner air to really differentiate between Pro and Air
2025-02-24T17:08:32Z,"I am in the unpopular category where I do want a thin MacBook, but I also want it to to have at least 3, preferably 4, usb ports an access for sd cards, and yes, a HDMI-access port. I don‚Äôt want to have to pay ‚Ç¨1900,- for that"
2025-02-24T17:08:06Z,"And I don‚Äôt. I want a portable device to become more portable with time. Nevertheless, Jony Ive was responsible for that 2021 redesign.¬†

When M1 was put in the same chassis as the previous Intel models, everyone suddenly started praising the design as the ‚Äúbest ever.‚Äù

It was Intel‚Äôs fault, and I‚Äôll be glad when they go bankrupt"
2025-02-24T18:56:13Z,"Same here. My M1 Max MBP replace my 2013 MBP, so I just kind of ‚Äúblooped over‚Äù the no MagSafe, no SD reader, touchbar era."
2025-02-24T21:21:59Z,"Honestly the current form factor of MacBook pros seems pretty idea to me. I wouldn‚Äôt say no to more IO, but other than that I wouldn‚Äôt be upset with incremental improvements for the foreseeable future."
2025-02-24T18:34:22Z,"This is spot on.

I also thought you were Jony Ive who forgot an apostrophe for a minute when you said ‚ÄúIve lost that critical editor.‚Äù"
2025-02-24T19:41:09Z,"&gt; Steve was Jony's editor.

A year after Jobs passed away, Scott Forstall was forced out of Apple. That's part of the reason lots of things went to sht. He and Ive may have not gotten along but together, they helped create balance between design and usability. When Forstall left, Apple mostly focused on design and usability suffered.

&gt; I'm happy Apple is building products that are more usable than in the Ive era. Especially on their pro lines.

Same. I refused to buy those butterfly keyboard macs and paid more to get a used 2015 under AppleCare in 2020 (the one I needed wasn't easy to find). I didn't want to get a newer model because I new how bad the 2016-2018 pros were in terms of functionality and the 2019 model still had too many issues. Now I have an M1 and it's definitely better than the 2016-218 models, in terms of functionality. I justr wish it was more repairable and upgradable."
2025-02-24T19:46:04Z,"Forstall had too much pride and didn't realize he was a mere rook or bishop on the board being protected by a king that had already fallen.

All he had to do was pen a 3 paragraph ""I'm sorry Apple Maps isn't up to par, it'll be our goal to improve it and I look forward to updating you in 180 days and 1 year from now.""

Instead he dug in his heels and Cook had to fire him. Jobs was able to mediate between Ive and Forstall... Cook was given the order by Jobs that Ive was untouchable, but no such order for Scott Forstall came."
2025-02-24T16:21:04Z,"This is such a good analysis, and I'm sure it's true. I have loved many Jobs / Ive era products, but agree that once Steve passed, some things started to go south."
2025-02-24T17:11:54Z,"South in‚Ä¶ what way? My dude, people have been crapping on Apple design for years, including when Steve was alive.¬†

The much beloved iPhone 4 design was CHASTISED when it was leaked. Everyone thought it was the fugliest thing ever, and it wasn‚Äôt a mock up. It was the real thing. And people thought it was so ugly it was fake. Same thing with original iMac mouse. Same thing with the Cube. Same thing with MacBook Air.¬†

If Apple isn‚Äôt getting criticized, that‚Äôs a concern"
2025-02-24T15:27:05Z,"The 2016 MacBook Pro was my first and only MacBook I‚Äôve bought. I loved the form factor but over time, I resented the 4 USBC ports, the stupid keyboard, and non upgradable ram or ssd, back when in 2016, those were still standard on many laptops. 

My 2 year old accidentally drowned it in Gatorade and I felt relieved to see it go. Went and bought an XPS after. 

Funny thing though, the same design choices that make a laptop infuriating to use makes iPhones so good. iPhones are better imo, when things are locked down, waterproof, and nearly portless. I like Bluetooth connectivity with Apple Watch and AirPods, just in a laptop, there are a thousand things that you just want a wired connection. Even if the conference room at my work or the study rooms o used back in college had Bluetooth, why would I go through the trouble of finding and connecting when an HDMI cable can just easily and instantaneously be used. 

I get those problems have been fixed, but I still have a feeling of irritation whenever I see a MacBook"
2025-02-24T16:04:45Z,Worst timing. I kept my 2010 MBP until finally replacing it with an M1 Pro because of all the terrible ideas that made its way into the touchbar/butterfly keyboard lineup.
2025-02-24T20:00:39Z,I kept using mine until 2020 and then got a used 2015 MBP (Apple was no longer selling them).
2025-02-24T15:41:27Z,"Dude you got t-boned on your learner‚Äôs permit. That doesn‚Äôt mean driving is the worst thing ever. 

I‚Äôve owned MacBook Pros from 2008 to now, my work bought me a 2016 and I hated that device so dang much I hoarded 2015s until the 14 inch MacBook Pros came out."
2025-02-24T17:21:58Z,Yeah I‚Äôd probably give the M series a chance if I needed a laptop. My xps is collecting dust now that my work provides laptops. But the M series do look pretty good
2025-02-24T15:30:15Z,So you got the worst MacBook Pro ever made and decided to apply your experience to every one before and after it that was way better?
2025-02-24T15:43:17Z,"Yes. First off, I don‚Äôt owe Apple anything. I have an iPhone because I like it but I have zero allegiance to the company. I gave them $3000 and in return, I got the worst MacBook ever made and had to deal with it for about 4 years. It over heated, keys stuck, and had zero expansion. So yeah, they lost me as a MacBook customer."
2025-02-24T15:52:52Z,"I‚Äôm not saying you have to bow down to Apple. It‚Äôs an understandably terrible experience and your own money they played with. Just pointing out the irony of you being in a thread where everyone is openly discussing how that MacBook was a mistake that was corrected and not representative of the vast majority of MacBook experiences, and that you are phrasing it like this is what Macs are like fundamentally instead of just a bad model. For the purposes of conversation, you looked potentially either ignorant or willfully misleading."
2025-02-24T17:19:44Z,"Sure, my point in bringing that up more to comment on Jonny Ives design decisions. 

Like I said, those same decisions worked, imo, really well on the iPhone but just didn‚Äôt translate well to a laptop. 

Wasn‚Äôt trying to be hypocritical, just adding a comment to  that period"
2025-02-24T17:50:00Z,"That aspect was an insightful point, for sure"
2025-02-24T17:38:57Z,I see someone reads Ben Thompson lol
2025-02-24T17:55:13Z,I‚Äôm more of a Snell and Gruber guy but Ben is insightful too.
2025-02-24T18:09:37Z,Love Gruber as well. I mainly mentioned because I have seen Ben use that \`Steve was Jony's editor.\` a lot in recent years :)
2025-02-24T18:24:16Z,"It‚Äôs very true, and I‚Äôm sure I heard it from one of those guys. The interesting thing is that unlike Tim or any of the bean counter C level executives, Steve Jobs would **really use** the prototypes and stress test. He‚Äôd spend an entire Sunday messing about with iPhoto or the calendar. No stone unturned, *pages of feedback on Monday morning*.

Nothing Tim or his executive team clearly are bothering with."
2025-02-24T18:26:57Z,"Yup, and it was very apparent when none of the execs wore Vision Pro on stage."
2025-02-24T19:42:28Z,"Work issues me a Vision Pro - perk of being the Mac admin... and it's undeniably a cool product. However, would I spend $3500 of my own money on it cool (plus tax)? **Certainly not**.

My biggest gripes with it are the lack of compelling apps (especially that there's no real game support with a controller), the weight being too much for long term wearable comfort (and I've got a 7.75 hat size melon dude head that can barely handle it) and the price being too high for any widespread adoption.

The other issue is that it's *very* isolating. When I've got it on, my wife/daughters become invisible and it removes me from the house, even worse than me staring at my phone or spacing out watching TV.

These are big issues that Apple is going to have to figure out if they want it to be a solid product line, long term. iPhone numbers it will never do... but even to hit iPad Pro numbers would be a mountain. 

Cutting the weight and price in half, and getting developer holdouts onboard with free development hardware... would be a good start."
2025-02-24T21:37:06Z,Why do designers and artists need editors ? Just because you assert it doesn‚Äôt make it a fact
2025-02-24T15:12:16Z,"Met Ive once, lovely guy actually, but before the first iPhone launched, he was pained to put a camera in a phone!"
2025-02-24T20:38:26Z,"If he didn't want a camera on the phone back then, wonder what he must think about the enormous cameras jutting out of the back now haha"
2025-02-24T20:50:08Z,"If he was in the grave instead of Steve, we‚Äôd be able to power the world with his spinning."
2025-02-24T15:21:40Z,"Wow, one of the only nice comments here. Where did you meet him? That‚Äôs so cool!"
2025-02-24T16:23:32Z,"By the way, I think your comment got hidden.¬†"
2025-02-24T17:03:43Z,I see it
2025-02-24T14:36:39Z,"From a design and functionality standpoint, I agree. They should not be trying to follow in Steve's footsteps. But Steve was also a brilliant marketer, and they would be foolish to throw away some of his practices."
2025-02-24T15:22:33Z,A reasonable and sensible comment!
2025-02-24T14:28:28Z,"Ive is one of those people that needs to be kept on a short leash when it comes to the kinds of unilateral design choices he makes. And he absolutely should never have the ability to override the technical folks. He has proven he will gimp the device just to make it ""pretty"". Which is a net negative when we are talking about a tool and not an art piece."
2025-02-24T14:30:37Z,I‚Äôm really curious about this. What are some examples of designs that he‚Äôs made that‚Äôs gotten in the way?
2025-02-24T14:35:14Z,"Bendgate with the iPhone 6, butterfly keyboards on the 2016-2020 Macs, Touch Bar having a virtual Escape key until 2020 come to mind"
2025-02-24T16:39:24Z,What about that MacBook with only a single USB C port? His as well?
2025-02-24T18:46:50Z,Unironically I think that 12' Macbook was too ahead of the time because othe intel chips. That thing overheated and shit battery life and shit performance like no other.Throw an M2/M3 in that bad boy and bring it back with an updated design and most likely it will sell.
2025-02-24T19:10:38Z,"I would disagree that the single port was a bad thing for that laptop. The form factor truly was the best ultra-light that could possibly exist. 

The problem with the MacBook was that it thermal throttled."
2025-02-24T15:59:37Z,I don‚Äôt get anyone‚Äôs hate on the iPhone 6. I think the 6 through 8 were the best ones. And mine never bent nor did it seem weak enough to ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
2025-02-24T14:33:13Z,Magic Mouse comes to mind I think
2025-02-24T15:11:23Z,"The Magic Mouse is the way it is because of Jobs. There‚Äôs a funny story about him looking at mouse designs and rejecting all of them except an early draft of a low profile mouse, and then the Magic Mouse was born."
2025-02-24T16:06:11Z,He wanted the port on the bottom because he didn't want people to use it while charging because the cable looked cluttered.
2025-02-24T15:52:56Z,"I don‚Äôt understand why they didn‚Äôt just drop the port and add MagSafe to the bottom, and offer a $100 mouse pad with MagSafe. Big L Apple"
2025-02-24T17:51:59Z,A $180 Magic Mouse with MagSafe charging? Who is buying that?
2025-02-24T19:50:13Z,"*Apple Consumers*. Besides it‚Äôs not like you need the mousepad, you can use any MagSafe charger. We‚Äôre talking about the same company selling mediocre folding keyboards for iPads for $300+ that sell like hotcakes."
2025-02-24T14:39:40Z,"Butterfly keyboards. Magic Mouse. iPhone 6.

Make the device 10% thinner with a 33% smaller battery. Thanks Ives. I would happily buy a 50% thicker phone with a 8000 mah battery, which also would keep the phone from immediately overheating in the sun or gaming."

2025-02-24T14:48:04Z,This one was the right call and it would‚Äôve paid off if Apple hadn‚Äôt simultaneously made the wrong call of keeping iPhones and iPads using Lightning for so long. The whole industry would be in a much more standardised place and I fully respect Ive for attempting to push things forward. Fees from MiFi gimped everything.
2025-02-24T14:57:50Z,"It wasn‚Äôt that they *added* the USB-C ports. It‚Äôs that they paired that decision with the *removal* of a bunch of useful and standard ports. Look at the Macs now: they still have the USB-Cs, but they now also have HDMI and SD card reader along with Magsafe. This is how it should have been all through, and I would blame the regression on Ive: too much focus on being pretty (‚Äúno extra holes!‚Äù) and not enough on what is used practically."
2025-02-24T20:56:21Z,"Yes that‚Äôs exactly right, and it was intentional. Thunderbolt can do the job of all of those ports, many of them simultaneously. USB, Ethernet, HDMI, Power delivery, all from one kind of port, over one cable. But because they didn‚Äôt give the industry *enough* of a push, we‚Äôre stuck with peripherals that require legacy ports, devices that have legacy ports, and a usbc standard that‚Äôs horribly fragmented."

2025-02-24T14:28:46Z,"&gt;Sir Jony Ive, the innovative designer of Apple‚Äôs iMac, iPhone and Apple Watch, and a close friend and ¬≠collaborator of the late Steve Jobs, says he still often asks himself: ‚ÄúI wonder what Steve would do?‚Äù

&gt;Ive told BBC Radio 4‚Äôs Desert Island Discs on Sunday that he does so despite the fact that Jobs had specifically told him not to before his death in 2011, aged 56.

&gt;‚ÄúHe used to say I really don‚Äôt want you to be thinking ‚ÄòWell, what would Steve do?‚Äô,‚Äù Ives said.

&gt;The designer, who was born in Chingford, Essex, and moved to San Francisco to work at Apple in 1992, worked alongside the company‚Äôs ¬≠co-founder and CEO five years later, when Jobs was called back in to help the struggling company after a period working elsewhere.

&gt;Jobs‚Äô return marked an immediate improvement for Ive, he recalled. ‚ÄúIt was remarkable that, despite the limitations of my ability to communicate, Steve understood what I thought and how I felt,‚Äù Ive said.

&gt;He told host Lauren Laverne that he feels Jobs‚Äô reputation as demanding and ruthless is unfair: ‚ÄúIf you have such a clear, pure view of ¬≠creating something new ‚Ä¶ if you are serious about actually wanting to develop and make it, you can‚Äôt just say ‚Äòwell, here‚Äôs an idea‚Äô because if that‚Äôs how you‚Äôre going to behave, it will remain an idea.‚Äù

&gt;He added that he couldn‚Äôt read anything about Jobs for 10 years after his death.

&gt;The designer, who grew up in Staffordshire, bemoaned the lack of understanding about art and design in many schools and recalled how he felt his intelligence was questioned by teachers because he was shy and wanted to spend time making things.

&gt;Fears that the technology he has helped to create could now be interfering with human creativity worry Ive, he said, adding that he finds it difficult to monitor his own use of technology. While he praised all the benefits that have flowed from the arrival of the iPhone, he said he feels a responsibility for the unintended, negative aspects. This is in his mind when he makes decisions about the tech of the future, he added.

&gt;Ive‚Äôs concern about the threat posed by AI is mixed with his excitement about its possibilities, he said. His main worry is the unchecked speed of development. ‚ÄúWe need time to understand and react,‚Äù he said. He did not give details of the AI project he spoke about working on last autumn with OpenAI CEO, Sam Altman, but is enthusiastic: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs probably the first time in my career that I‚Äôm inspired by capability in this way.‚Äù"

Do you really think it was just Ive who pushed everyone to implement this design? He also created 2019 Mac Pro which is fully modular.

2025-02-24T14:15:21Z,"From the article: Apple plans to launch a second-generation AirTag in May or June this year, according to a post today from a leaker known as [Kosutami](https://x.com/Kosutami_Ito/status/1893941895761444872).

Bloomberg's Mark Gurman previously reported that a new AirTag would be released in mid-2025. May or June would align with that timeframe.

Below, we recap three new features rumored for the AirTag 2:

* With a second-generation Ultra Wideband chip, the AirTag 2 is expected to have up to 3√ó longer range compared to the current AirTag. The chip debuted in the iPhone 15 and the Apple Watch Ultra 2. On the iPhone 15 and iPhone 16 models, there is a Precision Finding for People feature that can help you to find your friends in crowded places, and it offers a range of up to 200 feet/60 meters.
* The new AirTag's built-in speaker is expected to be more difficult to remove or tamper with, as an anti-stalking safety measure.
* The new AirTag is rumored to have improved integration with the Apple Vision Pro.

The original AirTag was announced during an Apple Event in April 2021. In the U.S., an individual AirTag costs $29, and a set of four costs $99.

Kosutami is best known as a collector of prototype Apple products, but they have occasionally shared accurate information about Apple's future plans. For example, they accurately revealed that the iPhone 16 Pro would be equipped with a metal-enclosed battery many months before the device launched. However, their August 2024 claim that new AirPods Pro would be coming ""soon"" did not pan out, as AirPods Pro 3 have yet to launch.

In another post today, Kosutami seems to be once again implying that new AirPods Pro are on the horizon, along with new Apple smart home accessories. Apple is expected to unveil an all-new smart home hub this year, and it is also rumored to be working on a Face ID doorbell and a smart home camera for release in 2026 or later."

2025-02-24T18:01:13Z,"I'm surprised there isn't a $300+ Hermes Wallet with an airtag built in. If you built it into the wallet then it wouldn't have to be as thin as a card since it could help makeup part of the structural integrity of the wallet.

Or maybe they want everyone to buy a wallet that slaps on the back of your phone, or never need a wallet because everyone adopts apple pay and virutal driver's licenses in apple wallet."
2025-02-24T20:57:59Z,"I would love to never need a wallet, but we still have a long way to go on that front.

Here in the US, most stores now accept Apple Pay, but a few big brands (notably Walmart and Kroger) are still holding out. Gas stations are also still about 50/50 where I live.

The biggest issue for me, though, is getting more states to accept virtual driver‚Äôs licenses."

2025-02-24T15:31:45Z,"Yeah I know it's suboptimal, but mine is deep in my wallet and I don't even notice it. I may have gotten rid of some cards I don't use in order to compensate."
2025-02-24T16:34:59Z,My issue is the wallet I use holds cards only and a more minimal wallet hence why all the current option dont work as well.

2025-02-24T16:28:02Z,"Agreed. The third party options that you can find online work well enough, but most if not all of them that aren't just torn down AirTags don't support precision finding."

2025-02-24T17:59:28Z,"Agreed. This is key. I know the 2032 battery wont fit, but make it a rechargeable flat battery or something. The tech is there. It won't be as flat as a credit card, but it could be 2-3 cards thick"
2025-02-24T16:14:12Z,"I have a 3rd party one and it doesn‚Äôt do precision tracking but that‚Äôs not exactly how I ‚Äúlose‚Äù my wallet. For me, I just like knowing that if I somehow leave it behind somewhere‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm going to get a notification and then I realize it happened. One day when they add precision finding I‚Äôll upgrade but this has given me serious peace of mind considering how annoying it is to lose a wallet."

2025-02-24T21:00:14Z,"Yeah, it's a weird choice. Never had this issue with a Tile. Really frustrating when I've left my keys in a pair of pants in the laundry bin. It's literally like finding a needle in a haystack."
2025-02-24T15:01:10Z,"This is more a Find My feature, but I wish I could tune and customize the ‚Äúitem has been left behind‚Äù feature. Make some items more sensitive during parts of the day.

For example, if I leave my laptop at home on an in-office day, I‚Äôd like to know as soon as I pull out of the drive way, not when I‚Äôm a getting on the express way. Same with my wallet. I need to know I left it at the restaurant as I‚Äôm leaving, not when I‚Äôve gotten home.

I‚Äôm thinking maybe I could set some items as high priority when I‚Äôm out of the house, and have it monitoring the distance and telemetry of spatial change in real time, even if it sacrifices some battery."
2025-02-24T16:37:17Z,"I have the opposite problem, I get a notification many times when I am with the item with me (mainly the Airpods seem to have this problem). It happens so often that sadly I don't even check anymore cause I know I have it with me, will definitely lead to me losing something at some point.

But, any type of customization is welcome in my mind."
2025-02-24T18:30:51Z,"I wish you could link it to calendar events or certain days. I don't need to know I've left my passport at home the vast majority of days. However, the day I have an international flight I would like the reminder on, and if I'm in the headspace to forget my passport, I'm probably not in the headspace to remember to turn the Forgot Item notification on for it either. It's more of a Calendar app change than a Find My or Air Tag change, but add options to events to say ""On the day of this event, notify me if Passport left behind"", etc."
2025-02-24T21:00:34Z,"I don‚Äôt think that will happen because you need to apply the filter of tracking a person. If it‚Äôs tracking a person too well, you need more safeguards to counter. That‚Äôs likely how we ended with such a delay in notification."
2025-02-24T21:15:05Z,"It won‚Äôt happen because Apple doesn‚Äôt care and won‚Äôt ever think to do it.

However, the whole deal with ultra wide band is that two objects can understand their spatial relationship to each other. In this case, all your phone knows or cares about is how far away the object is, and after that number is too high, alert you.

You‚Äôre not tracking a person. You‚Äôre checking a distance."
2025-02-24T21:17:34Z,I wish it could integrate with the parking location detection and suppress warnings when I leave my stuff in the car.

2025-02-24T14:29:33Z,"I know it won't happen, but I want full cross-compatibility with these trackers between Android and Apple.

Otherwise you go to an ""iPhone country"" and your Android tracker doesn't have good coverage. Or you go to an ""Android country"" and your AirTag doesn't get good coverage.

Also, Google went too conservative with the privacy features. It's not enabled by default on low traffic areas and needs multiple devices to be in range of the tracker. So, again, it makes it even more annoying to use it in an ""iPhone country"".

Not to mention being able to detect unknown trackers without needing a third party app installed just for that, for example.

Nor that even within Android I don't think they all use the same network...

Even if it isn't full 1 to 1 functionality, the networks being compatible should be ideal."
2025-02-24T15:42:48Z,"A standardization of a protocol would be ideal. That way, compagnies can make the chip how they want but they still get to be cross platform and working no matter the phones used. Everyone wins in this situation.

But given the stalking danger that‚Äôs already in place with the AirTags, I don‚Äôt expect Apple to have even 1% of interest in collaboration"
2025-02-24T16:06:02Z,"&gt; But given the stalking danger that‚Äôs already in place with the AirTags, I don‚Äôt expect Apple to have even 1% of interest in collaboration

Not sure how big of a problem the stalking really is. But if it is a big problem, then it makes even _more_ sense to have one standard network.

If I put an AirTag on someone that has an Android, they can't know they have an unknown tracker following them unless they actually installed the special App.

And I'm pretty sure it's the same the other way around, you can't know you have a Tile, Samsung, whatever on you with an iPhone.

So all you need to do to make it more likely to not be discovered, is use a different tracker from the phone your target uses...

I'm sure there are apps or ways to ""scan"" to see if there are any bluetooth devices around you or something. But it's not something that everyone has by default."
2025-02-24T20:31:10Z,"It does make more sense, but probably not on Apple‚Äôs mind. They‚Äôve been against opening protocols for years for ""security concerns"""
2025-02-24T15:19:26Z,I am 100% with you on that. I feel like Apple has locked it down to tightly behind their system that it will never happen. I can see google much more willing to just have an open standard that anyone can tie into and then have the info shared across platforms.
2025-02-24T16:10:34Z,They‚Äôll make a new everything except the AirPod maxes
2025-02-24T14:26:03Z,"I have a feeling they will severely nerf the ability to track an object after it‚Äôs been taken from you. The best use for these imo. 
They seem to now target these as a key ring finder."
2025-02-24T14:34:38Z,"It‚Äôs been marketed for lost, not stolen, items repeatedly. Never once, ever, have they said it‚Äôs for stolen items."
2025-02-24T18:54:10Z,People are definitely still going to use them for stolen items though.
2025-02-24T16:53:08Z,They've never targeted them as an ant-theft device
2025-02-24T18:17:55Z,I hate it when my ants get stolen! üò§
2025-02-24T19:29:12Z,"No, the ants steal your device"
2025-02-24T19:10:12Z,I never said otherwise.
2025-02-24T14:47:33Z,Umm never been marketed that way. It was always marketed as a way to fund your misplaced things.
2025-02-24T14:33:07Z,"Most people are using these to track items in case they get stolen, which obviously isn‚Äôt their intended purpose but that‚Äôs the market they appeal to. 

I know very few people that are using these things for their intended purpose."
2025-02-24T16:36:13Z,"I mean I have an AirTag on my keys and wallet in case they get stolen, but also in case they get lost outside, in my house, etc. I think both can be true"
2025-02-24T15:06:55Z,What is the intended purpose?
2025-02-24T15:08:45Z,"To help find misplaced items around the house. Keys, remotes, bags, etc."
2025-02-24T15:13:31Z,Not just around the house. You can misplace your wallet somewhere else. Just a couple weeks ago I left a sling at a Vegas casino after going to another. I was able to check the AirTag in my wallet to verify it was still there before going back to get it.
2025-02-24T15:24:08Z,"The one I see complaining about it the loudest use it incorrectly but honestly most people I know use them for their  intended purpose.  Tracking their own items not to make sure they dont get stolen.

Everyone putting them on their keychain is using them for that purpose.  The other purpose I use mine often times for is when I fly to track my luggage by throwing a tag in there.  It confirms if it made it on the plane or got left behind plus if my luggage is missplaced or lost at an airport I can then find it more easily.  
  
Another big one is I tossed one in my kids backpack when we go places. Mostly for the case when it gets dropped I can go find it more easily. Lastly when my family has gone to Disney land we toss a tag in the stroller. Mostly because it does get moved by the staff or moved in stroller parker so the tag makes it easier to find it.

Again all correct uses of the tag."
2025-02-24T16:54:08Z,Just give me a wallet-friendly version
2025-02-24T16:55:12Z,Just make it smaller and thinner. Nobody cares about extra features
2025-02-24T15:38:18Z,"&gt; The new AirTag's built-in speaker is expected to be more difficult to remove or tamper with, as an anti-stalking safety measure.

I hope they've figured out the unnecessary beeping then, because otherwise the value of Gen1 is going to rise

All of the other touted improvements are a 1 on my scale of importance when when compared with how annoying the speaker is. I leave an AirTag in my car and the beeping when I was driving was driving (no pun intended) me crazy."
2025-02-24T16:37:28Z,I'd like to see them smaller in diameter. So I can place them in expensive instruments that have a way of walking off. I don't care if people know they are attached. It's just a cumbersome size.
2025-02-24T16:41:46Z,"Finally, the killer feature I have been waiting for - Apple Vision Pro integration.  Now if they could just make the speaker loud enough so that you can hear it if your item is in a bag‚Ä¶"
2025-02-24T16:48:04Z,I‚Äôm interested in what the find my integration will look like with the Apple Vision Pro. It would be cool if the near by feature showed the location of the AirTag in your real space.
2025-02-24T17:05:26Z,"We got one to track the cat because he has a nasty habit of bolting out the door.  Last time he got out, he was in the neighbors back yard and the air tag couldn't find him until I was practically on top of him.  I heard his cries for help long before the tag found him.  Hell, half the time it won't even pick him up if he's still inside the house.  This is all my way of saying I'm excited for an extended range."
2025-02-24T17:20:45Z,I‚Äôd love one that didn‚Äôt require getting a ping from a device to locate to.  My luggage was stolen recently in Barcelona and I was chasing it down but ultimately I was always lagging behind it until I just found it in the bottom of a dumpster at 3am.
2025-02-24T18:15:38Z,"That would require a constant cellular or GPS connection on the AirTag itself, which would be expensive, require a much larger form factor, and make for a battery that does not last anywhere near a year.

[GPS dog collars](https://shop.tryfi.com/products/smart-collar-v3) are probably the closest currently available tech, and they are rather large compared to AirTags, have a three-month battery life, are expensive, and require a dedicated cellular plan.

So maybe get one of those for your luggage? No clue if it works internationally tho."
2025-02-24T21:26:14Z,"My wife either dropped her wallet or got pickpocketed and we went on a wild goose chase trying to recover it. It updated several times but it wasn't until the next day that we eventually located the AirTag in some bushes by a road, but it had been removed from the wallet and probably tossed out of a moving vehicle. Bummer."
2025-02-24T18:05:56Z,How will this work with 16e that doesn‚Äôt have an UWB chip
2025-02-24T19:29:04Z,"It‚Äôll probably just have performance similar to the current AirTag then, it won‚Äôt exclusively work with devices that have the UWB chip, much like how 5g phones also support 4g service."
2025-02-24T18:49:06Z,"I got an AirTag for Christmas 2023, I love it. Granted, I haven‚Äôt needed to use it once but it‚Äôs cute to have. I got my closest friend one for this past Christmas. I have a 13 Pro Max so I‚Äôm doubtful the new model‚Äôs features will be of use to me, at least all of them. Time will tell"
2025-02-24T20:17:42Z,Hope they finally fix the bug with different AirTag locations showing on different devices.
2025-02-24T21:37:16Z,How about a wallet version with all the features and the ability to change the battery or charge.
2025-02-24T20:22:41Z,"It‚Äôs eerily similar to what they released in 2021. Maybe we‚Äôll see it again in 2029!

&gt; ""Four years ago, a few months after Mr. Biden‚Äôs inauguration, Apple announced an ‚Äúacceleration‚Äù of its U.S. investments, pledging to spend $430 billion and add 20,000 jobs over five years. In January 2018, during Mr. Trump‚Äôs first term, the company said that its ‚Äúdirect contribution to the U.S. economy‚Äù would be $350 billion over five years and that it planned to create 20,000 jobs over that period""

apparently this is just the standard press release they roll out at the beginning of every new presidency"
2025-02-24T20:38:21Z,I wonder if they used ChatGPT or Apple Intelligence to rewrite this press release.
2025-02-24T21:26:46Z,That's as lot of added compute power for what could be an automated e-mail task they set up decades ago.
2025-02-24T20:28:23Z,"Quick, what's 430 after you factor in inflation!"
2025-02-24T20:20:53Z,I guess those tax breaks come in handy
2025-02-24T20:26:28Z,The generational conditioning that things made outside of the US is to be cheaper for consumers inside the US is criminal. It was only a good thing for big business to exploit lower wages in other countries.
2025-02-24T21:03:31Z,"I have not been a fan of either Trump presidency but one good thing that his arrival on the political landscape has done is make voters agree that globalization only ended up benefiting people who were already incredibly rich both at home and overseas. He hasn't done much himself to do anything about that, but through Reagan to Obama we were told it was a good thing we all need to support and vote for."

2025-02-24T04:04:09Z,Hasn't it already for 99% of people? It's only really hobbyist now
2025-02-24T04:23:01Z,"Even as someone with a good ""real"" camera I don't have it on me the majority of the time. That's why I find value in a high end phone; if I'm carrying something with me all the time I'd like it to have the best camera available"
2025-02-24T04:44:05Z,"And the other thing is if you know you need a ""real"" camera, you know you need a real camera. Smartphones have made leaps &amp; bounds but no amount of computation or binning will beat the physics, low light performance, and dynamic range of a larger sensor"
2025-02-24T05:49:40Z,"For now. I‚Äôm a photography nerd and honestly it‚Äôs gotten kind of insane. I know there is a theoretical limit, but it doesn‚Äôt feel like it.

Edit: people pay me to take pictures, I know big cameras aren‚Äôt going anywhere. I just think it‚Äôs spectacular that a camera that is built into your phone can take a useable photo in a night scene since not that long ago that was out of the question for DSLRs."
2025-02-24T06:06:05Z,"The difference is that much of the improvements in smartphone imaging nowadays is due to software and signal processing- something the photographer has virtually no control over. So if you want full creative control, you will always need a standalone camera body and lens system."
2025-02-24T06:41:38Z,"Definitely. But at the same time, that feels like a lot of what‚Äôs been going on with mirrorless cameras now too, especially with improvements to dynamic range. The stacked sensors, the machine learning noise reduction, and the insane ‚Äúshutter‚Äù speeds sometimes feel like they‚Äôre as much software as hardware improvements, meanwhile optical improvements have felt a little stagnant. The A9III is the coolest most innovative camera that I feel like we‚Äôve gotten in a while, but it‚Äôs stuck with Sony‚Äôs boring glass. Canon has been pushing the boundaries of existing glass but it just feels like plastic-y versions of lenses that already existed (albeit with amazing new zoom capabilities) and I think that‚Äôs kinda boring. Weirdly, Nikon feels like it‚Äôs doing the most weird and exciting shit with their mirrorless glass, they just cost an insane amount of money. 

Like fuck it, make another 300 f/2, bring back the 200 f/1.8, and just generally push the limits of optics.

I want to make weird pictures with weird lenses. I don‚Äôt need a 32,000th of a second exposure at 102,000 ISO. Not everything needs to look like an Edgerton photo."
2025-02-24T07:41:11Z,"I don‚Äôt know if this is quite as bad as you make out.

The Nikon Z mount glass is absolutely amazing compared to the older mounts. New opportunities because of the mount, plus new design software is obviously making a huge difference in optical quality.

And as good as the new phones are, they still don‚Äôt hold a candle to the quality from a decent Mirrorless system. You can easily tell the difference when enlarging or seeing the depth of field vs the AI simulated ones.

And as far as ‚Äòweird‚Äô goes, there‚Äôs plenty of old and odd lenses that can be adapted to the new bodies - that produce images that just can‚Äôt be naturally ‚Äòprocessed‚Äô by software."
2025-02-24T08:16:56Z,"This, nothing beats a mirrorless system's true depth of field. You can really tell a difference."
2025-02-24T07:54:08Z,"Oh it‚Äôs not bad, I‚Äôm just being picky. I‚Äôm excited about the current state of and the future of cameras. I just also want some new weird mainstay lens. Like give me a 50-100 1.4 or something weird. Like just weird inevitable commercial failure lenses."
2025-02-24T06:18:46Z,I‚Äôll need a camera until it can replace very long and fast telephoto lenses. And that‚Äôs not gonna happen. Physics are physics.
2025-02-24T14:30:32Z,"The thing that blows my mind with my phone is how good a night photo it can take *handheld*

Sure, my MILC (basically the most recent evolution of the DSLR-style professional camera for anyone unaware of the acronym) can take a better night photo‚Ä¶ from a tripod. But my phone can do it in my hands

For me the main reason I still use my MILC is telephoto lenses - an iPhone maxes out around 120mm equivalent whereas my longest lens gets out to 480mm. There‚Äôs [really no substitute for focal length](https://photographylife.com/telephoto-lens-focal-length-comparison), and 480mm equivalent isn‚Äôt even close to the longest lens I could buy"
2025-02-24T12:34:33Z,"Also, a choice of real lenses."
2025-02-24T05:23:02Z,"Ya it‚Äôs really a hassle to carry an actual camera with you. Plus if you go to like the beach or a theme park you definitely aren‚Äôt gonna carry a real camera with you. I have felt this way since the galaxy s7 (it came out 2016) with how good it was. For reference this is a photo I took with the the s7

2025-02-24T05:37:47Z,It‚Äôs come to a point where I‚Äôll get looks whenever I take my mirrorless camera out. It‚Äôs a compact one too (Fujifilm X100VI). I purposely bought the black version so it doesn‚Äôt stand out as much and it helps but people still stare. No one looks once let alone twice if you pull out a smartphone to take a photo.
2025-02-24T07:11:22Z,They‚Äôre looking because you bought a camera with intentionally visually striking looks.
2025-02-24T05:42:18Z,Apple had a whole ad campaign about shooting high quality professional video with an iPhone . Their commercials were shot with one .
2025-02-24T06:37:40Z,"I mean, the top youtubers are all using professional cameras for their recording. It does work better and its more consistent performance in different environments and lighting. Its also way more flexible in editing and such. And has higher resolution which makes a difference even when compressed down."

2025-02-24T06:16:39Z,"Probably why this article specifically mentions that's the point:

&gt; One of the goals for 2025‚Äôs iPhone line is to get the vlogging community and other video creators to move away from standalone cameras and use the iPhone for even more of their work."
2025-02-24T07:26:10Z,"Sometimes we just want to keep our devices separate. If you‚Äôre out and about, having a dedicated camera that‚Äôs a few hundred $$ that has a changeable battery etc is easier to work with. 

Also, sometimes I don‚Äôt want my $2500AUD phone in the same situations as my cheaper camera.

iPhones are already good enough as a video camera. Many huge YouTubers just use iPhones for a main camera vlog content."
2025-02-24T08:19:05Z,"&gt; iPhones are already good enough as a video camera

2025-02-24T05:30:42Z,"Man iPhone is great for general everyday stuff. But nothing beats a real camera if you want a an actually decent pic. 

I use a 10 year old d750 and it consistently does better than anything a phone can do."
2025-02-24T06:36:43Z,"Yup. My ten year old RX100 will take a better photo than the the iPhone 16pro. Can‚Äôt beat physics, optics, and lenses."
2025-02-24T04:23:53Z,"When the 15 pro added log recording that was an actual game changing feature that completely levelled up the iPhone as a video tool

I frequently use my iPhone, mounted on top of a proper video camera as a b cam shooting a basic wide shot. 

By shooting in log im able to get the two cameras to match properly. 

It really is amazing to have such a high end image coming off such a small device. 

For my money there are two key areas that Apple can improve to make the iPhone a better professional video tool

1. Either add a variable aperture lens or some sort of electronic ND. 

Bottom line is, we need to be able to shoot with a 180 degree shutter. 

The fixed f1.7 aperture lens is no good for video. An iPhone lens that could go from f1.7 to f16 or lower would be an instant upgrade for me

2. It‚Äôs such a darn pain getting files off the iPhone. 

While the Pro iPhones now get usb3 transfer speeds, in practice. This just isn‚Äôt the case. Transferring files off the iPhone, via a wire, within that weird finder view is both painful and extremely slow. 

Beyond that some open gate recording modes so we can capture the entire sensor would be welcome. 


But I suspect that to come for vloggers, they‚Äôre gonna be introducing some kind of lidar enabled subject detection autofocus mode and perhaps a tally light  on the back of the phone?


Somewhat unrelated but a great video creator tool they could add to the iPhone would be the ability to use the iPhone as a monitor. 

Some sort of way to plug your iPhone into your camera and monitor your shots through the iPhone would be a great way to sell a lot of pro maxes to video creators"
2025-02-24T04:52:43Z,"The tech is very close to making all of these things possible, some already are.

I have not used this, but Final Cut can do a multicam session with multiple iPhones and iPads. 

There is also a video capture card that allows iPads, maybe an iPhone? To use the screen as an hdmi display. 

Thunderbolt on an iPhone would be cool, iPads have that.

Doesn‚Äôt the iPhone use the LiDAR sensor for the cinematic mode where it switches to who is talking?"

&gt;While the Pro iPhones now get usb3 transfer speeds, in practice. This just isn‚Äôt the case.

However, if I'm serious about the video, I'm recording external to SSD, which also makes workflow a breeze.  Still, using an external SSD isn't always going to be a practical solution and regardless exporting needs to be better."
2025-02-24T04:27:31Z,"I used to use my phone for youtube videos by I find the built in storage limiting and the fact that it uses a lot of battery annoying. For example if I record a video in the morning half my battery is gone and half the storage, I have to charge before going out.

2025-02-24T04:40:11Z,Strap an SSD onto your iPhone? iPhone 15 and later can do this via the USB-C port.
2025-02-24T04:57:15Z,Definitely thought about it. But another issue is the phone gets hot and can overheat
2025-02-24T05:29:41Z,the phone gets hot and the SSD gets hot and the whole thing just stops recording warning you it‚Äôs too hot

2025-02-24T04:44:50Z,"I need more storage to shoot 4k 60fps 10-bit prores. What is it, like 13.2gb per minute of video recording?"
2025-02-24T05:03:32Z,"now if only Apple can improve their crappy photo AI, maybe the iphone can replace my camera for photos too."
2025-02-24T04:02:43Z,"I‚Äôve found iPhone Audio being an impediment not the video quality.

Not quality, but how iOS handles it and lets me monitor it.

And as far as I know still can‚Äôt record Bluetooth + every single mic. Must choose one."
2025-02-24T04:28:13Z,What‚Äôs a ‚Äúcamera‚Äù
2025-02-24T04:43:54Z,"Are you filming me? No, I'm taking a *Live Video*‚Ñ¢ of you."
2025-02-24T05:22:32Z,Idiots need to first increase base storage. You ain‚Äôt replacing anything with shitty 128 gb.
2025-02-24T07:09:40Z,Apple really are stretching now to find reasons to upgrade to their latest phone. Time to switch to two or even three year cycles and stuff in an S if really needed in between.
2025-02-24T05:45:35Z,I sold my Nikon DSLR and lenses a few years back that I bought new when I was super into photography in high school and college. iPhone cameras have gotten ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù that I didn‚Äôt feel the need to lug my gear around when on adventures and doing things I‚Äôd typically bring the camera for. Having a decent phone camera available in your pocket is a game changer.
2025-02-24T06:27:37Z,get rid of ai smoothing and i'll consider it
2025-02-24T11:01:31Z,The lenses need to get A LOT better. The insane amount of hard light ghosting reflections makes it instantly clockable
2025-02-24T05:50:26Z,Maybe for outdoors in bright sunlight. The sensor is just not big enough to be able to replace a video camera for the people left who still use them.
2025-02-24T03:58:33Z,"Let iPhones take better videos so you will need even more memory on your phone and cloud, plus an even better MacBook to edit them. Sounds like a no brainer."
2025-02-24T06:44:30Z,"I didn't see any mention of increased resolution.

4K is realistically the maximum anyone will need for the foreseeable future.

Some Android phones do 8K, but that's a gimmick.

Unless we all will have an IMAX-sized movie theater at our house, you're not seeing any difference between 4K and 8K on a 65"" TV from several feet away lol"
2025-02-24T07:07:55Z,If only Apple solve a device to view content like this
2025-02-24T05:13:10Z,They‚Äôre managing expectations for the September reveal where the only innovation is better cameras (for the seventh year in a row). That being said my 14PM screen is cracked and battery is dog water so I‚Äôll be buying one.
2025-02-24T04:03:36Z,So Apple wants nothing? Because that is already the reality we live in.
2025-02-24T04:26:15Z,(They mean your iPhone 16 Pro)
2025-02-24T05:03:14Z,"Fix the lens flare and we‚Äôll talk, imo"
2025-02-24T05:34:43Z,How about fixing the over processing in photos instead
2025-02-24T06:41:33Z,Doesn‚Äôt it already?
2025-02-24T07:09:01Z,The best camera is the one you have with you.
2025-02-24T10:21:11Z,The best camera is the only camera you have on you. Simple.
2025-02-24T13:47:01Z,"What‚Äôs with this camera obsession? My pictures look fine. Come up with something else. 

Jesus H."
2025-02-24T03:56:19Z,Really hoping this means higher resolution video recording (8k??)
2025-02-24T03:59:11Z,"Im assuming better quality 4k. Which is what people should want. No one needs 8k from that tiny sensor. 
I would rather have bigger sensor for better dynamic range and lowlight.

This is coming from someone who owns an Android that can do 8k. I cant even share it properly. You barely can with 4k"
2025-02-24T04:10:01Z,6k would be nice so that you can crop in post and not go below 4k
2025-02-24T04:12:27Z,The iPhone is more than capable of doing 6k 60fps open gate I assume
2025-02-24T03:57:47Z,8k recording with 128gb. 5 min video?
2025-02-24T04:00:42Z,iOS will definitely choose a lower res by default like it already does for a lot of modes (most people are not using the camera system to the max). For the pros it would be great to have 8K as an option even if it means storage would be an issue. There's enough USB-C storage capabilities thanks to the new port. 1TB is cheap and easy to get.
2025-02-24T04:11:46Z,Doesn't the current ProRES format of 4K require external storage? I thought I saw a disclaimer when I enabled it one time.
2025-02-24T03:58:50Z,Why do you need to record in 8K? You have displays regularly available that you are watching 8K content on?
2025-02-24T04:12:15Z,"1. Footage filmed at 8k can be cropped and manipulated without loss of quality prior to downsampling to 4k.
2. Record archival-quality footage now for when 8k is more popular (think filmed TV shows getting re-scanned for HD)"
2025-02-24T04:09:46Z,"Resolution isn‚Äôt an issue. 

A fixed iris is the single great weakness the iPhone has as a video camera."
2025-02-24T04:00:35Z,8K by itself won‚Äôt help with anything. On that tiny of a sensor it‚Äôs all gonna be crunched through image processing anyway. Waste of storage and bandwidth at this point in time.¬†
2025-02-24T04:33:57Z,"We need 10bit 422, better low light, more dynamic range, higher quality video with less compression artifacts etc."
2025-02-24T05:03:41Z,"Apple seem clueless here.

  
Until Apple include inbuilt ND filters so you can control the shutter for video, its going to always look like cheap fast-shutter consumer video. No matter how many pixels and software tricks they want throw at it. There's a reason why video from an actual camera, controlled by someone who knows what they're doing, looks the way it looks."
2025-02-24T04:04:37Z,"Demographic that still owns a camera for video recording is not relevant, headline is worded like it‚Äôs 2005."
2025-02-24T13:35:27Z,Time to eat some dried fruits to honor him today.
2025-02-24T13:41:16Z,"then walk around in the office later with no socks or shoes on, and then dip my feet into the commode"

He was the best in interviews. Fantastic public speaker."
2025-02-24T13:31:21Z,He‚Äôs dead
2025-02-24T13:11:48Z,I don‚Äôt think he really cares mate

2025-02-24T18:43:43Z,"Happy bday, jobs!"
2025-02-24T21:29:32Z,"You were gone too early, miss you, Steve"
2025-02-24T14:28:33Z,Cue idiotic comments from people on this website
2025-02-24T13:59:22Z,He was a genius. His iPhone 4 design was the most beautiful iPhone and Phones and general ever made. He changed the world in 2007.
2025-02-24T15:02:33Z,iPhone 4 was Jony Ive tho
2025-02-24T15:07:55Z,"He had at that time the lead about the design, I know. But I think that Steve Jobs had the final word."
2025-02-24T16:54:43Z,"The lead on the iPhone 4 design was Richard Howarth, who created the design in 2007, and who leads the ID team today"
2025-02-24T18:53:00Z,Steve Jobs was always very involved in the design of Apple-products. He was very close with Jony Ive. I believe Steve Jobs really had a big impact on the design.
2025-02-24T20:14:40Z,"Yes, he did. But I‚Äôm explicitly saying that every design in the ID studio has a project lead who is responsible primarily for pushing it, and Richard Howarth was iPhone 4‚Äôs ID project lead. This has been reported online. Very little is know about how the ID studio functions, but that is one of the few things we do know that‚Äôs been said"
2025-02-24T21:02:06Z,Then I agree. Misunderstood. Tired.

2025-02-24T13:17:43Z,"Steve, if you can hear me, Tim Cook gave Dictator Trump a million bucks for his ‚Äúinauguration‚Äù"
2025-02-24T15:07:06Z,Let's be real. He probably would have done the same.

2025-02-24T16:33:36Z,Why?
2025-02-24T14:28:05Z,"If he was alive, he wouldn't donate a penny to the felon."
2025-02-24T15:03:58Z,"He definitily would, because he was a businessman at end of the day, and not exactly an ethical one"
2025-02-24T18:56:18Z,TDS
2025-02-24T15:42:16Z,Fuck Steve
2025-02-24T16:55:18Z,Lmfao do you feel better? Rude as hell.¬†
2025-02-24T14:11:33Z,"He never invented anything. He was in the right place at the right time, incredibly twice, to take credit for other people's work, while he obsessed over the shape of the cases and the design of the logos. The original ideas he did have were so incredibly wrong, we don't talk about it today (no third party apps on the Mac or the iPhone. And he was a truly awful person in his personal life. When he found out he had cancer he delayed his cancer treatment by 9 months to try to cure himself with alternative medicine."
2025-02-24T13:30:40Z,Deathday
2025-02-24T13:46:08Z,Nah that's October 5th
2025-02-24T12:01:51Z,"Is this regulatory approval or is it now enabled on the iPhone by Apple in the UK? Regulatory approval was obtained in Australia several months ago, but Apple still hasn't made the feature available there."
2025-02-24T12:07:41Z,"&gt; As previously reported in January, the AirPods Pro 2 can now be used as hearing aids in the United Kingdom, having now received government approval for over-the-counter hearing aid devices.

It's enabled and available."
2025-02-24T12:22:25Z,"What a helpful thing. So many people who need a hearing aid, don‚Äôt need it bad enough. AirPods may just be available, instant increase in QoL."
2025-02-24T11:50:27Z,"Be aware that if you have severe hearing loss in either or both ears, this won't work for you. 

The UI isn't particularly clear about this and it doesn't warn you the hearing aid feature is not available if, as I did, you use a stored audiogram. I might do another test later when it's quiet.

Setup notes are here:

https://support.apple.com/en-gb/120992

_Edit: added some clarity._"
2025-02-24T14:18:52Z,"I had my grandfather, who's 100% deaf in one ear (since birth) and 90% in the other, try them out and they actually worked for him, so I guess it just depends. He actually preferred it to his hearing aid."
2025-02-24T20:48:42Z,"The feature is absolutely fantastic for listening to music with adapted profiles. But as actual hearing aids, sadly really useless compared to a proper high end model (admittedly at 10x the cost and more). 

I‚Äôm now wearing HAs and the AirPods were my first experience. But comparing them to my Phonak Spheres also made incredibly clear that Apple is only at the beginning of a journey. Looking forward to what‚Äôs available in another 5 years from now."
2025-02-24T18:07:55Z,Hope it comes to the EU soon... I would really like to try the noise protection function.¬†
2025-02-24T16:37:21Z,yeah cool but give me back my ADP
2025-02-24T19:33:23Z,So I can get AirPods by prescription now?  ü©∫
2025-02-24T13:09:34Z,"For anyone reading this with hearing issues, try out a pair of bone conduction headphones. They don‚Äôt work in all cases, but I‚Äôve had three different friends / family try them out, and they‚Äôve been life changing for two of them."
2025-02-24T15:08:40Z,"The bone conduction headphones can work for an outer or middle ear issue, and can be brilliant for those who it works for, but to my knowledge not as a hearing aid, but simply a pair of headphones."
2025-02-24T21:13:51Z,"My dad has severe hearing loss in one ear, to the point where his hearing aids don‚Äôt work any more. He‚Äôd resigned himself to just not being able to hear in that ear, as he doesn‚Äôt want to go the route of cochlear implants. I brought over a set of my bone conducting headphones to try, and he found that he could hear clearly with them for the first time in years. He now uses them along with the iPhone as a mic to take part in conversations again, and connected to the TV to hear movies etc. 

I never claimed that they were hearing aids, I only suggested that people struggling with hearing issues should give them a try. My dad was told he had inner ear damage, so these shouldn‚Äôt have worked.. but they have, and they‚Äôve significantly improved my dads life."
2025-02-24T05:09:44Z,"They will be over 50 percent hardware profit margin once they cut all the Qualcomm and Broadcomm fees for cellular, satellite and WIFI."
2025-02-24T06:13:02Z,"They could keep the same profits while dropping the iPhone price! üòÉ

(lol)"
2025-02-24T07:24:18Z,Don‚Äôt be silly.
2025-02-24T09:57:56Z,"This might sound silly but from another perspective, they may actually be able to do this and justify it if they‚Äôre able to get services profits up. 

At that point, if the service profit per user is high enough, it could be worth more to drop the iPhone price to lock in new customers that pay for services. Could be enough to offset decreased iPhone profits."
2025-02-24T12:11:59Z,"If they can make Apple One a big deal, improving TV, Music, News, and Arcade, along with iCloud+, it's a no-brainer that they could shave $50 off iPhones if people paid $200 a year for Apple One while keeping that device for 3 or 4 years (average people who don't upgrade their iPhone every year). The ecosystem is bigger than just the hardware itself now, though I think the push for paid services is still a bit nascent. There's some work to be done to make TV, Music, News, and Arcade irresistible."
2025-02-24T17:42:13Z,"It's a nice thought, but after them dumping the SE to launch the 16e it doesn't seem likely."
2025-02-24T16:55:28Z,"with upgrade cycle now being a lot longer than it used to be for a lot of people, this could actually be feasible strategy especially for lower end models......except they *just* released a very underwhelming phone for 600...so maybe Apple isn't interested in this strategy."
2025-02-24T07:32:01Z,"Yeah, right"
2025-02-24T08:35:32Z,Lmao
2025-02-24T07:35:10Z,"What‚Äôs the rundown on what the make / own vertically now? 

Modem
Chip set
What else"
2025-02-24T07:53:27Z,"&gt; What‚Äôs the rundown

I don't know, but it sounds like the rundown's really important"
2025-02-24T07:54:31Z,"I just faxed, a rundown , to my dad."
2025-02-24T08:17:02Z,Make sure to fax it to everyone on the distribution list too.
2025-02-24T12:27:39Z,It won‚Äôt be that simple. They will still need to pay a good amount of royalties for the standards essential patents that all of these companies contribute too.
2025-02-24T12:55:00Z,I‚Äôm sure a lot of the reason they purchased the Intel modem division was patents.
2025-02-24T05:09:03Z,I wonder if it means when they make newer Apple Silicon Macs that they will finally get a cellular option built into the chip.
2025-02-24T05:53:29Z,I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised honestly. Makes sense.
2025-02-24T06:08:40Z,Pleeeeeeease do this Apple
2025-02-24T08:58:36Z,"Would that mean that all MacBooks would be cellular or would they produce two variants of each chip with/without cellular, 

Or they just add it as an extra to the top chip. For example M5 pro? I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôve said this out loud. That‚Äôs definitely what they will do isn‚Äôt it."
2025-02-24T09:49:01Z,They would probably sell it as a 100‚Ç¨ addon like with ipads.
2025-02-24T06:21:11Z,That would make the MacBook Air truly portable
2025-02-24T07:33:09Z,"I‚Äôm still very happy with my M1 Pro, but if they did this I would upgrade without hesitation."
2025-02-24T13:02:39Z,What does this get you that tethering your laptop to your iPhone doesn‚Äôt?
2025-02-24T13:04:50Z,Independence from your IPhone.
2025-02-24T13:20:28Z,How often would you be on a laptop and not have your phone though? Just seems like a situation that is pretty rare in my opinion
2025-02-24T15:06:14Z,"Don‚Äôt have to worry about killing the iPhone battery by using it as a hotspot.

Anecdotally, I work with a lot of concert merchandise reps who carry around hotspots for their work computers still and i know most hate it."
2025-02-24T15:12:21Z,Fair point
2025-02-24T14:48:56Z,"You're right, but people are willing to pay more for convenience. I never owned a cellular iPad for that reason (just used my iPhone as a hotspot), but I totally get why others see having that instant, always on data connection as a big selling point (despite the additional data plan)."
2025-02-24T16:02:29Z,All consultants use it. Lenovo Thinkpad has that option.
2025-02-24T18:56:47Z,Amazing. That will be $20 a month plus taxes and fees making it $35‚Ä¶.
2025-02-24T21:18:35Z,"Battery life mainly, but it also saves you the minor inconvenience of connecting to your Hotspot each time, and then having to turn off the Hotspot(on your phone) when you‚Äôre done."
2025-02-24T05:31:46Z,Likely? That was the entire reason to develop their own modem (integrate it within the main SoC).
2025-02-24T07:17:54Z,The actual reason is that they don‚Äôt want to keep paying Qualcomm.
2025-02-24T08:38:07Z,"that too, but a discrete modem and all those chips take up a lot of extra room inside the phone

integrating it into the SoC over time will save a lot of space and reduce costs"
2025-02-24T10:58:40Z,"Integrating into SoC will cause die size increase, and considering M series chips are already at size limit this doesn‚Äôt seem possible."
2025-02-24T12:19:19Z,Care to explain the die size limit in detail?
2025-02-24T20:33:29Z,"The machines that make semi conductors can only work up to a certain size: and the closer you are to that limit, the more errors (losses) you will have. 

That is why chiplet designs have become so popular. By splitting up the chip, you can add more components without increasing die size, although it does add some complexity and latency."
2025-02-24T13:29:06Z,The primary use case is for A series. I am sure they can still use a separate modem in laptops.
2025-02-24T15:56:13Z,Apple might be waiting for the 2 nm and beyond before the integration.
2025-02-24T20:23:36Z,Power management.
2025-02-24T06:20:40Z,"Well, there‚Äôs also just getting away from third-party manufacturers which is probably an equally large reason."
2025-02-24T05:46:05Z,Exactly. What even is the point of his posts üòÇ
2025-02-24T06:02:24Z,"Those who can‚Äôt create, gossip."
2025-02-24T06:56:04Z,"Why? It will increase the size of the SoC, leading to bad yield, fewer transistors, or higher costs, unless Apple adopts chiplet/MCM designs.

What benefits can you expect from the integration?"
2025-02-24T07:35:38Z,"Lower power for the phone, lower cost for the system."
2025-02-24T07:57:35Z,"It will add like 10-15% more to the die area which is fine, in comparison to Qualcomm's 8 elite, its \~125mm2 and the X80 modem in that is \~12mm2 if you subtract that to the soc then the soc without the modem included its 113mm2. A18 and A18 Pro is 90mm2 and 105mm2. Lets say their modem is 15mm2 then using the A18/pro it would be 105mm2 and 120mm2."
2025-02-24T05:05:46Z,...waiting on you airport next gen.
2025-02-24T05:17:32Z,I doubt it. Since most of the former Apple employees who worked on the Airport &amp; Time Capsule are now in Unifi
2025-02-24T05:48:43Z,And i‚Äôm okay with that. I use ubiquiti at work and at my house and I love their products.
2025-02-24T05:59:13Z,"Ubiquiti is way better than Netgear

I don't take constructive criticism"
2025-02-24T14:56:13Z,"I don‚Äôt think anyone‚Äôs gonna debate you there. Is the equivalent of saying

‚ÄúA Porsche is better than a base Altima‚Äù"
2025-02-24T06:56:34Z,"I've found them unreliable, but I know they are popular.

I had multiple firmware bugs with their products that they refused to fix, even after I filed bug reports with them."
2025-02-24T10:38:47Z,"You're supposed to buy the newest iteration of their product, not try to fix the one you already paid for, duh

Also the AP you bought just a year ago is now EoL"
2025-02-24T16:32:33Z,"I ended up just switching to TP-Link, and their APs have been working flawlessly for me."
2025-02-24T05:25:25Z,[removed]
2025-02-24T06:09:45Z,"It can, but to what end? The router space is too crowded now that everyone has a mesh product. It‚Äôs also a high-frustration product that can tamper with brand sentiment"
2025-02-24T06:25:34Z,"It's a high frustration product that apple always has a means of making products seamless. Do I think that they will re-enter? No...probably not. Rumors persist but I am skeptical but if your argument is ""apple doesnt get involved in disjointed markets."" Well I mean obviously look at VR, Homekit, TV. Not to mention that it wouldnt be too difficult to integrate other products within the mesh router system. I could easily see a homebase/ homepod display that has a router and nodes having mesh capability but also speakers. It's not likely but it's certainly not an idea out of left field."
2025-02-24T06:28:36Z,"You may want to checkout Ubiquiti Unifi. Their Unifi Express is amazing even at WiFi 6. Unifi is waaaayyyy better than anything garbage Netgear has to offer. Fyi, most of the ex-Apple employees working on the Airport and Time Capsule are now in Unifi."
2025-02-24T06:36:19Z,I'm actually quite familiar and they make an amazing product from my understand though it does seem more intended for complete home integration as opposed to an off the shelf solution that i'd suggest the majority would prefer.
2025-02-24T06:37:10Z,"It‚Äôs not that I think they won‚Äôt as a rule, but there needs to be more upside to do so, and that upside isn‚Äôt there in a saturated router market. I imagine that Google and Amazon are getting value from customer data that Apple wouldn‚Äôt."
2025-02-24T10:47:16Z,Do you really think a near $4T company doesn't have a (backup) plan if a few employees left the company?
2025-02-24T06:09:10Z,Really wonder what reviews will say. I know it took them a lot longer than they expected and was harder than they thought according to articles. I wonder if itlll actually be as good as Qualcomm or not be as good speed/reception. If I was in the market for 16e I‚Äôd wait for reviews
2025-02-24T06:59:59Z,"People in the market for the 16e don't care about the modem being 10% worse lol

We already know it's worse, it doesn't support mmWave 5G (mostly only used by Verizon in the US)

but otherwise it will work fine.

Despite some sensationalized articles, the Intel modems also worked fine for most people."
2025-02-24T11:13:33Z,"I honestly don‚Äôt care if it gets less bandwidth. Generally the most bandwidth intensive features I‚Äôm  using in cellular mode is either FaceTime or streaming music and LTE speeds are adequate for both. 

## However‚Ä¶

I imagine many people will care about reception, and how the new antenna handles those edge cases of really really low reception. Like would a Qualcomm antenna be able to make calls while the Apple cannot? Or will calls drop more often in poor reception areas? Etc"
2025-02-24T16:41:24Z,"&gt; Like would a Qualcomm antenna be able to make calls while the Apple cannot? Or will calls drop more often in poor reception areas? Etc

They've been testing it and working on their modem for 6 years now, I would expect it's very well tested."
2025-02-24T11:46:26Z,Surely the only reason the C1 isn‚Äôt is because the A18 is also used in phones with Qualcomm modems? Presumably the second they bring it *all* in house they‚Äôll become integrated.
2025-02-24T16:16:58Z,"That's a great point! I completely forgot that they are using an older integrated chipset on this 16e model... so does that mean the 16e technically has two cellular modems in it?

Which means they are still possibly paying Qualcomm a fee for every 16e sold? Haha. Maybe it also could be an emergency fall-back with some sort of firmware update, if the hardware turns out to have some sort of major issue... Can't wait for an in-depth teardown of this thing!"
2025-02-24T05:13:27Z,"File under the ‚Äúno shit‚Äù category.

Samsung et al have benefitted from Qualcomm‚Äôs chip being all-in-one, which boosts performance and power efficiency. So the fact that Apple has been outclassing Android phones many times on battery life despite that major disadvantage goes to show they know what they‚Äôre doing, and the recent boost of 5 hours from 16 hours to 21 hours of video streaming from the 14 to 16e shows Apple can increase battery life with their modem.

I‚Äôm very excited for the future of C chips, and that they will improve no matter good, bad, or otherwise in successive generations

Edit:

Lmfao a moderator removed someone‚Äôs negative comment on Gurman.

Gurman sucks, and he has to say a bunch of obvious stuff to counter his obvious misses.¬†

2025-02-24T06:58:12Z,I'm sure they put out some false information to try to narrow down who is leaking things.

2025-02-24T09:22:01Z,"iPhone 16e has a larger battery..the modem alone doesn't suck much power compared to the Qualcomm ones. Display is the largest energy user, followed by chipset itself"
2025-02-24T06:16:02Z,Any pics?
2025-02-24T05:04:00Z,Wow really!!!!üò±
2025-02-24T10:53:44Z,Another mind blowing Gurman prediction
2025-02-24T10:57:44Z,If they build it on the same nodes as the newest A chips then we‚Äôll see even more power efficiency gains
2025-02-24T15:32:30Z,"Here's hoping it mean better battery life down the road. I notice that my battery life is pretty solid at home or places where I have wifi. But if I'm out and about in new locations, I can barely check my phone and the battery level still takes a hit."
2025-02-24T06:17:22Z,Will there be any cool shit Apple will be able to do by doing this other than save money?
2025-02-24T06:56:44Z,"Sigh, yes. Also they aren‚Äôt saving money here lol"
2025-02-24T09:05:30Z,I **HOPE** this means there‚Äôs no more iPad cellular and wifi model anymore.
2025-02-24T12:15:50Z,"Knowing Apple, they will just price everything at cellular level, because it is a ‚Äúmuch magical experience now‚Äù."
2025-02-24T13:01:38Z,"Knowing Apple, they'll put the same chip in each device and deactivate areas of the chip in some models of Macs, for example, to keep their precious pricing ladder. You want cell connectivity? No problem, you need this model (with the chip turned on)."
2025-02-24T11:40:51Z,Welcome back Google Pixel camera module
2025-02-24T13:41:35Z,"Reminds me of the Nexus 6P camera ‚Äúfiasco‚Äù. People were going crazy saying it was the ugliest thing they‚Äôve ever seen. Others were saying they didn‚Äôt mind. It was controversial at the time.  

https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/s/HRiVqFPf9u"
2025-02-24T13:57:44Z,"And after only a few weeks/months, it'll be just fine. I thought Airpods were hideous when they were released (""they just took regular earbuds and cut the cable"", which TBF was probably the intent), and now I still don't love them but... I'm just used to them"
2025-02-24T13:59:18Z,"I forgot about the AirPod backlash lol. There were so many memes and shitposts on Reddit when they came out. People thought they looked ridiculous and that nobody would ever wear them. I thought they looked silly too, and now I‚Äôve owned multiple pairs lol."
2025-02-24T14:20:59Z,I think the 6P has one of the most aesthetically pleasing cameras on any phone
2025-02-24T15:13:49Z,Damn I miss metal phones. I do love wireless charging but also miss the cold metal and solid built feeling.
2025-02-24T18:08:08Z,One of my faves of all time. Until the bootloops.
2025-02-24T16:48:08Z,Yeah but the pixels looks waaay better üíÄ
2025-02-24T17:47:34Z,"It looks more like the dynamic island than like Google‚Äôs design.

Exact same placement and all"
2025-02-24T17:50:10Z,"Yeah, but it‚Äôs close enough to be reminiscent of it, and it‚Äôs funny because Google is apparently killing that design this year"
2025-02-24T11:11:36Z,I remember that the ‚Äúhuge camera bump‚Äù of the iPhone 11 Pro (Max) got leaked and everyone went berserk. Then Apple unveiled the actual iPhone and everyone was like ‚Äúah yeah that‚Äôs fine‚Äù
2025-02-24T11:31:36Z,"Same with Watch Ultra. Render looked absolutely ass but it turned out fine, as usual."
2025-02-24T12:19:36Z,It's almost as if apple has some of the worlds best product designers and somehow those aren't matched by internet randos with some 3d skills.
2025-02-24T14:17:39Z,I guess they hired them after the current camera bump design?
2025-02-24T16:26:33Z,ü§°
2025-02-24T15:22:28Z,"Has there been any single mainline Apple product in the last decade that has been an actual design flop? The closest thing I can think of is the AirPod Max case. Otherwise, everything ranges from good to forgettable. They haven‚Äôt released anything daring enough to be considered awful or great since the trashcan Mac Pro in 2013."
2025-02-24T15:56:08Z,"I can‚Äôt think of any main products but there have definitely been a few accessories that were poorly designed.

The Apple battery cases with the bump were pretty panned when they released, even revisiting them the design is still horrible. You also have the Apple Pencil with its male connector and the Magic Mouse but they‚Äôre more of a functional annoyance."
2025-02-24T17:42:38Z,"Even the AirPod max are way more popular than I ever thought they‚Äôd be. Very single airport, bus and train is full of people wearing them or wearing a rip off."
2025-02-24T15:24:54Z,Wasn't this the same with the notch and pill? It seems any design changes people will not like and then they're fine with it.
2025-02-24T12:08:21Z,Happens every year!
2025-02-24T16:44:17Z,"I mean let‚Äôs be honest, the tri-camera setup is still ugly af"
2025-02-24T12:50:55Z,"If they fix the rocking back and forward when it's on a desk, that is all i care about. It's so annoying."
2025-02-24T20:16:45Z,Who really cares?
2025-02-24T11:46:47Z,I‚Äôm convinced the only reason the camera bump changes from year to year is to sell more cases.
2025-02-24T13:12:32Z,"It's so that everyone will know you have ""The Best iPhone we've ever made**‚Ñ¢ ""**"
2025-02-24T14:41:34Z,They also move the buttons a little every year
2025-02-24T17:25:36Z,People whine when the design doesn‚Äôt change. People whine when the design changes. Y‚Äôall are pretty insufferable lmfao
2025-02-24T17:38:21Z,Does it really count as a design change when the chassis is the exact same but the camera bump is a millimeter bigger and the volume rocker got pushed a millimeter down?
2025-02-24T20:10:25Z,A design millichange.
2025-02-24T13:51:32Z,"Well, larger sensors means shallower depth of field and better low light capabilities ie photos look more professional and video appears more cinematic. But this means larger lenses to focus the light on the sensor. Means bigger camera bump."
2025-02-24T18:09:58Z,"I love this take. 

Mostly because its for people with enough disposable income to buy a new phone each year being annoyed they can‚Äôt reuse their case"
2025-02-24T18:23:49Z,I mean who can afford to get a new phone every year but somehow draw the line at buying a new case? I mean you can get great clear cases on amazing for like $7.
2025-02-24T19:20:36Z,"Yeah, if your case is outliving your phone then you‚Äôre doing it wrong"
2025-02-24T15:45:13Z,"This isn‚Äôt a rhetorical question, have they ever kept designs consistent enough that you could keep a case when moving to the next iPhone?

I don‚Äôt remember ever doing that, but I haven‚Äôt bought every iPhone"
2025-02-24T15:57:12Z,I think this was generally doable during the #S era
2025-02-24T16:28:27Z,"* iphone 3G and 3GS

* iphone 4 and 4s

* iphone 5 and 5s and SE 1st gen

* iphone 6 and 6s

* *iphone 7 and iphone 8 (not sure about this one)*

* iphone x and xs (camera bump half a mm larger on the XS but most cases still were fine)

* iphone se 2nd and se 3rd gen

* iphone 13 and iphone 14

so basically last time, it was in 2022 with the iPhone 14"
2025-02-24T18:59:15Z,"I didn‚Äôt realize that the 13 and 14 were the same! 

Would certainly be nice if they did this every now and than again.."
2025-02-24T19:57:48Z,"The 13 and 14 are a mixed bag. Most 14 cases will fit on a 13 with a slightly looser fit around the camera bump, and while a good number of 13 cases were updated to have larger camera holes to fit the 14, cases for the 13 that have tighter tolerances around the camera bump [will not fit](https://cdn.pickr.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iphone-14-in-iphone-13-case.jpg) the 14. Apple's cases for the 13 don't fit the 14 because of this.

The 15 is also a weird instance, since some case makers eventually just made the same case for the 13, 14, and 15, but YMMV. To a similar extent, there exist cases that fit for the 6, 6s, 7, 8, SE 2, and SE 3, with camera cutouts large enough to support all 6 phones and the bottom being cut out to support the headphone jack. The XR and 11 are mostly the same dimensionally, so most 11 cases can actually go on the XR, albeit with a lot of exposed glass."
2025-02-24T12:11:09Z,"Is this suggesting that the body of the 17 Pro will feature metal wrapping around the back, with a glass panel (in red) for connectivity? That would be a super interesting design and a nice departure from the glass-sandwich, which has become a bit stale imo."
2025-02-24T11:52:49Z,It's fine but the 17's alleged design sticks out like a sore thumb in that line-up. It's the only one without a horizontal bar.
2025-02-24T12:41:37Z,"The lenses have to stay in that position because of the spatial video capabilities, I agree though."
2025-02-24T14:25:47Z,Insane dedication to a feature 99.9% of people won‚Äôt experience
2025-02-24T17:49:28Z,"Not this year. But in less than 10 years, we will be happy to look back at those videos.."
2025-02-24T12:58:08Z,Just hold it horizontally to make the bar vertical /s
2025-02-24T14:08:50Z,"yeah so it'll look boring and ppl will buy the Pros/Air because they look newer

Apple's entire product strategy is to make the more affordable products (that they still need to have because a decent portion of the customer base has a hard line for budget) look boring so that as many people as possible get nudged to the higher tier models"
2025-02-24T14:22:03Z,That design just does not make any sense.
2025-02-24T18:27:19Z,Looks horrible the only looks decent is the vertical camera position
2025-02-24T13:29:17Z,"What bothers me is that the lenses still stick out. If it was flush, the phone won‚Äôt rock anymore"
2025-02-24T11:09:33Z,"In before people say 'Thanks, I hate it.' CAD renderings and mockups based on leaks often don't capture how the real product will look like in person."
2025-02-24T11:13:55Z,"I mean, if there‚Äôs a good reason that the bump extends all the way across like something to improve the camera greatly then that‚Äôs fine, but if it‚Äôs purely aesthetic then that‚Äôs stupid.

I‚Äôm all for functional design changes if they make sense. Hopefully the camera bump acts the same as a widget so to speak, and now that it‚Äôs been enlarged it has a little more functionality than before."
2025-02-24T15:08:22Z,"the bump will increase in size until the entire back is flat again, going full circle"
2025-02-24T11:24:09Z,Maybe most of the phones motherboard is pushed up inside the new bumps and the rest is just screen and battery.
2025-02-24T17:48:46Z,"It looks exactly like the dynamic island, but on the back."
2025-02-24T13:27:49Z,Just like the Mac &amp; iPad lineup the iPhone lineup is becoming inconsistent.
2025-02-24T14:29:39Z,"They finally fixed the ass ugly square module with the 16, and now they‚Äôre gonna come out with something even uglier"
2025-02-24T11:51:34Z,Talk about ‚ú®consistent design language ‚ú®
2025-02-24T11:08:37Z,"&gt;The leaker Majin Bu has had some hits in the past, but some of his information has been wrong, including a rumor about an iPad 11 being imminent in 2023. What's different in this particular case is that Weibo-based leakers Fixed Focus Digital, Ice Universe, and Digital Chat Station have all backed the accuracy of the CAD image, based on their own information from Apple's supply chain in China. ""The appearance is basically like this,"" commented Digital Chat Station in reference to the image. It might just be time to get used to this new look."
2025-02-24T11:31:51Z,So the 17 air is more like an enlarged 16e as opposed to an enlarged 17? Who is going to want to sacrifice camera quality for a slightly larger screen?
2025-02-24T12:08:49Z,These all look weird. Then again so did the current design sketches at first. Leave it to Apple to deliver a polished product.
2025-02-24T12:41:46Z,"Okay, pulling the plug on the 16 Pro, this bump is insane"
2025-02-24T12:51:50Z,They are unofficial leaks... i would not base anything on them.
2025-02-24T13:23:13Z,"Oh, my friend, how you need to learn the ways of the Apple. These are tutti-fruitti, phoney-baloney, plastic banana, good time, rock-n-roll Apple PR ‚Äúleaks‚Äù to build hype."
2025-02-24T16:12:07Z,"Currently using the 16 Pro Max which already looks pretty ridiculous. We‚Äôve far exceeded the usage case for the general consumer now. There‚Äôs no reason to keep making the camera array larger if it‚Äôs going to detract from the form of the rest of the phone.

At this point I think it‚Äôs just a way for Apple to make each model differentiable and make a token improvement over last year without properly innovating."
2025-02-24T11:58:14Z,"If the red means glass, why the back of iPhone 17 &amp; 17 Air doesn‚Äôt have red back‚Ä¶ can‚Äôt be metal back, right?"
2025-02-24T12:56:19Z,"I‚Äôm assuming they only did the red on the 17 pro due to the fact that it had a different back. Otherwise, I would assume that it‚Äôs likely all glass. 

We‚Äôve also heard from FPT (take what they say with a grain of salt though) that the entire pro phone looks like a unibody. Which might point to Apple having integrated the glass with the aluminum to make them look nearly identical so you can‚Äôt even tell. Which I think would be a really cool design choice!"
2025-02-24T14:13:56Z,Similar to how it is on the MacBooks touchpad.
2025-02-24T12:21:14Z,What the actual fuck is Apple doing
2025-02-24T14:09:14Z,"Thriving. People have been bashing 
the initial leaks for years now and yet sales go up and up"
2025-02-24T18:48:10Z,Yea that's cool but I've been off the leaks since like 2022 so i genuinely have no idea wth is going on
2025-02-24T12:37:33Z,"Dylan G, is that you?!

Jk‚Ä¶ in all seriousness I said the same thing. Time will tell!"
2025-02-24T12:25:10Z,"I don‚Äôt think this is going to be 100% accurate however I‚Äôd like to use the opportunity to complain about the bump and want it to go. Flush out the back for more battery if possible. If not, still flush is out please."
2025-02-24T14:10:09Z,"Jeez.. those pro‚Äôs are ugly, such a weird dead space in between the lenses and flash. So not thought out. This feels like a bad render job made from leaks. 

Maybe they should have kept Jony Ive onboard. 

The Air tho, super sexy."
2025-02-24T15:08:56Z,Something I really like about the 16e is the simplicity on just one camera lens. This is just a mess.
2025-02-24T12:02:20Z,There is nothing ‚Äûrevealed‚Äú it‚Äôs an image from weibo
2025-02-24T12:46:02Z,"I know it will look better in real life, like always, but... this looks even worse than usual."
2025-02-24T13:10:37Z,Oh no‚Ä¶
2025-02-24T15:07:43Z,"If this is real, then maybe MagSafe is becoming a pro-only feature"
2025-02-24T15:16:45Z,Does the Pro look slightly smaller than the regular 17? Or would that be something not really accurate in a render.
2025-02-24T17:01:45Z,What does this lebensbumping actually get you though? The sensor + optics getting taller is one thing but are they going to make use of that extra z height?
2025-02-24T20:06:19Z,Just make the whole phone as thick as the camera!
2025-02-24T20:21:12Z,What is this? A game of dominos?
2025-02-24T11:53:27Z,"I still don't get it. Why slim phones? Are they warming us up for when future pro maxes(pro maxii?) folds?

Even Samsung and some Chinese companies are into it."
2025-02-24T14:14:49Z,It‚Äôs a new trend will compete with Galaxy Edge
2025-02-24T15:50:53Z,Absolutely disgusting
2025-02-24T12:44:36Z,"I‚Äôve had every tip of the line iPhone since the 4. Currently rock a 1tb 16 pro max.

I‚Äôm gonna probably get the top 17 pro max but I‚Äôm gonna say it:

This looks like one of those android phones."
2025-02-24T12:57:50Z,"They need to fix the lens flare first, it‚Äôs been prominent for a few generations."
2025-02-24T13:11:18Z,Looks like Apple is in for a major innovation ‚Äúever‚Äù
2025-02-24T13:53:08Z,Dammit! I was really hoping the 17 base model (the one I'm going to buy) would have the horizontal camera well
2025-02-24T12:08:33Z,What the hell with all those cameras. I just want a simple phone and a decent camera at cheaper price. Jeez why do people need that ? 48mp camera so they can sell more icloud storage‚Ä¶ quality is now good enough for 98% of the situations.
2025-02-23T23:56:08Z,Paid in exposure
2025-02-24T03:28:01Z,"During The Joshua Tree and Rattle and Hum period, U2 projected the image of earnest, politically conscious rock poets, blending spirituality, activism, and Americana into their music. Their message was deeply rooted in social justice, human rights, and a fascination with the contrasts of the US.

However, with the release of Achtung Baby, they abandoned (and even mocked) their politically conscious roots and later sought out big-money corporate partnerships with brands like Apple (2004 iPod deal) and BlackBerry (2009 tour sponsorship).  At that time I began to see them as being more like a stadium-rock money making machine using their brand to build personal wealth instead of making art.

The backlash peaked with the 2014 Apple album giveaway, where Songs of Innocence was automatically downloaded onto users' iTunes accounts, sparking criticism that they had overreached and lost touch with their roots.

They could have been perennial rock gods like The Rolling Stones had they not sold their souls.  Now, I don‚Äôt miss them a bit."

2025-02-24T10:44:46Z,"You should have chosen a different example. There was a time you couldn't get through a commercial break without hearing a Stones song. They are one the most corporate-connected musicians that ever were. You may not like U2s music, I don't much either but you can't deny their place in music. And whatever backlash they received, they still continued to fill seats. Even now, their Sphere show was massively successfully.  So there's really no need to go to the ‚Äúsellout‚Äù trope."
2025-02-24T16:34:35Z,"I'm not sure everyone going to see them at the Sphere is going to see \*them\* at the sphere, they're going to see \*the Sphere\*. It could be The Night of 1000 Beyonce Impersonators and it'd still be sold out."
2025-02-24T17:44:57Z,"It wasn‚Äôt coincidental. Whatever one may think about their music, U2 has always put on phenomenal live shows."
2025-02-24T12:44:18Z,The Stones are frequently sought out by companies looking to license their music. How much of U2‚Äôs catalogue can we say the same about? I can‚Äôt think of more than two songs that might get used for such purposes and one of them is really creepy.
2025-02-24T19:40:39Z,But did they chose for their music to be used in all those commercials? I remember the story about The Verve getting sued for using a sample from The Rolling Stones. But it turned out it wasn't the Stones who sued them but a business manager that had somehow ended up with the rights to the Stones music.
2025-02-24T15:07:10Z,The word sellout does not require quotes.
2025-02-24T07:30:29Z,I cannot stand U2. Makes my ears bleed.
2025-02-24T07:16:29Z,"&gt;They could have been perennial rock gods like The Rolling Stones had they not sold their souls. Now, I don‚Äôt miss them a bit

no they couldn't have been. 

The Rolling Stones are better musicians with better songs, which is what this all boils down to in the end."
2025-02-24T10:43:03Z,"Agreed, but the whole point is, you feeling like that is non-consensual"
2025-02-24T02:40:26Z,literally some of the worst exposure of their careers wouldn‚Äôt you say? Like everyone universally hated it lol and Corporate Overlord still made out like a fuckin bandit
2025-02-24T03:44:21Z,"This is earlier.  The commercial was for Vertigo off of How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb and the iPod was themed after that album as well.  All of the above was well received.

Apple later pushed a much less well-received U2 album to all of their users for free, but without consent.  This was the bad PR move, not the commercial and classic iPod collaboration, which made U2 seem cooler than they had in probably decades."

2012, and at the time the iTunes Genius music suggestion agent was top tier, then that happened and fucked it all up and never recovered.

My library never recovered and I couldn‚Äôt use itunes for music suggestions ever since.

Because the genius mechanic overlooked ALL your library and its music, and having to use that website to remove it from it never enabled the ‚Äòknowledge‚Äô the genius music system to be forgotten, it was a permament stain on your account at that point.

And yet people at the time continued to give us shit over a freebie that we complained about.

Unless users never used itunes at that time you had NO idea how painful that error was."
2025-02-24T20:12:59Z,there is no fucking way you had nothing in your library that sounded like U2 prior to that. It's a generic-ass band.
2025-02-24T02:47:06Z,This is one of those cases where any PR is good PR but I get what you're saying
2025-02-24T03:30:45Z,"I never heard of them, even once, outside of the one South Park episode with Bono. That might sound like a joke but that album was the first time I ever actually heard one of their songs. 

To this day, I occasionally listen to The Troubles. I go out of my way to listen to it, and it led me listen to more of their music. So they gained at least one fan out of it."
2025-02-24T01:40:04Z,I still have that fucking U2 album stuck in my iTunes!!!
2025-02-24T02:00:15Z,It‚Äôs a free album
2025-02-24T02:04:43Z,I don‚Äôt want somebody‚Äôs free garbage¬†
2025-02-24T01:04:52Z,"So, this is a mixed bag of a story and the headline is sort of true.

In Walter Isaacson's book he goes into detail about this deal and basically it involved U2 wanting to sell their entire collection on iTunes, but then things took a turn when they started backing out because Steve wouldn't allow the making of a black iPod (Steve was, until his dying day, very very hard to convince when it came to aesthetics).

Eventually Steve convinced them that staring in commercials (those dancing iPod once with silhouettes) would be good for them and give them more exposure for their then new record, ""How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb"" and it DID work. iPod commercials up to that point did not feature artists and only features random shadows dancing on like splatter paint artwork to a song, the artists themselves were never featured.

I have never ever heard of this part of the story in which U2 demanded stock... I know they ultimately settled for money and exposure, but never of stock."
2025-02-24T03:53:28Z,"Huh.  I owned a black iPod 5th gen.  It looked like this:

edit: also, the [U2 iPod](https://luxurylaunches.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/i-pod-6-1.jpg) was black with a red wheel."
2025-02-24T12:47:34Z,I had the sixth generation in matte black. I have no idea where it is now. I‚Äôve moved house twice since I last saw it.
2025-02-24T16:01:49Z,"Yep, with the introduction of the 5th generation iPod with Video, they switched the colors to silver and black from the previous all white design.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod\_Classic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod_Classic)"
2025-02-24T02:20:22Z,U2 was one of the last bands on earth that needed exposure or free marketing. There's absolutely no way of knowing what their Apple commercial did for album sales. It's more than likely Steve just kept insisting that they do it for free and they just gave in and said fuck it whatever it'll just be cool to do this Apple thing. They were long time musicians at that point that knew their way around business conversations. This all sounds very exaggerated honestly
2025-02-24T00:17:45Z,"That website is such trash lol tf

I think that it‚Äôs is still stuck in the U2 era"

2025-02-24T01:09:38Z,Remember you had a free album on your iTunes account? That was the only time I hated free stuff.

Did Bono get on his hands and knees and say ""Please Lord Jobs, bless us with Apple stock""?

Or did U2 start contract negotiations with stock options?"
2025-02-24T01:52:10Z,Fairly certain U2's popularity died the moment that album hit our iTunes. ¬†If it didn't I know I didn't think about them seriously ever again.
2025-02-24T10:42:51Z,"Yes, wildly unpopular. Which is why one couldn't get a ticket for their Las Vegas residency at The Sphere, which was the fourth highest grossing residency of all time. And of course there was the sold out Joshua Tree Tour that spanned 2017-2019 before that. Nobody likes them anymore. üôÑ"
2025-02-24T00:39:51Z,"If they wanted stock so much, they should‚Äôve called a stock broker like the rest of us. 

If Jobs got them to do their work for nothing, I don‚Äôt think they were underpaid."
2025-02-24T08:15:52Z,"Are you for real? Called a stock broker? It‚Äôs not unusual to be paid in stocks or shares for certain deals, heck staff at Microsoft get given shares in their bonus schemes via yearly appraisals or they used too."
2025-02-24T11:40:24Z,"Stock-based comp is extremely common. 

But if you‚Äôre a millionaire complaining to the press about a publicly traded company not paying you in stock, I have no sympathy for you at all. You could have very easily called a broker if you felt that strongly about it (after the deal is announced)."
2025-02-24T10:31:36Z,Maybe he was cheap
2025-02-24T14:42:12Z,I don't like U2 but this was a bad thing that Steve Jobs did lol

2025-02-23T13:27:18Z,"Best product they‚Äôve released in years. Yes, even with the pitiful base storage and insane upgrade cost elephants in the room."
2025-02-23T13:34:44Z,"&gt; Best product they‚Äôve released in years

It's not the best _product_ per se, it's the price/value that absolutely dwarves most Apple products.

Apple has made many fantastic products. But usually they are either expensive or come with extremely low capacity ram/ssd and then a slight upgrade costs 50% of the full product."
2025-02-23T13:40:37Z,"I don‚Äôt want to get into a semantics debate about whether it‚Äôs the best product for shareholders or customers‚Ä¶ or whether it‚Äôs the best only in terms of value‚Ä¶ or whatever metric you‚Äôre using. I‚Äôm not interested. 

The thing fucking rules. It eats up tasks. MacOS has always ruled. And now you get it in something more portable than a Nintendo GameCube. It beats the shit out of the Vision Pro, it‚Äôs more interesting than the iPhone 16e and Apple intelligence. I honestly don‚Äôt think they‚Äôve released a product this compelling since the homepod mini."

2025-02-23T15:52:38Z,"I wouldn't use ""compelling"" and ""HomePod"" in the same sentence. HomePod was only cool for people who wanted something that already existed in multiple form factors but with an Apple logo on it."
2025-02-23T18:46:48Z,What's good for shareholders and what's good for consumers seems to be opposed to eachother for the last few years IMO
2025-02-23T14:12:37Z,"I wasn't trying to go into a semantics fight.

My point was the iPhone is a fantastic product (you are just used to it because it's been great for years). The AirPods are great. The Macbook (Air and Pro) since the M1 are also fantastic.

They are all great.

But the Mini M4 is great while also being the most accessible to most people. That's what's different.

I'd argue though the M1 Macbook Air was the previous one. It was significantly better than the competition, and at really good price. Even more the following year when M2 came out.

But the obvious difference is that its cost was twice the Mini M4, so even if great value, it's still a bit of a ways off compared to the Mini.

To me the only thing the Mini is missing, that I wish it had, is power through USB C."
2025-02-23T13:31:51Z,"I upgraded mine to 2tb with a drive from aliexpress, cost around USD200 which was very reasonable."
2025-02-23T13:34:00Z,"I think I‚Äôm gonna do something similar a bit further down the road, but for now mine‚Äôs everything I need. Probably not gonna use aliexpress though‚Äì no judgement."
2025-02-23T13:40:11Z,"It's better than nothing, but it's still pretty annoying it's not a standard nvme drive, which would be cheaper and from reputable brands."
2025-02-23T19:51:55Z,"The thing is Apple is literally making their product worse by doing what they did because their proprietary format (literally a M.2 NVME with the pins moved around a little) is SLOWER than the regular one. 

They make the majority of their profit margins off of storage upgrades and it leads people to iCloud, so I can't imagine it's changing anytime soon. I just hope NAND manufacturers find some silver bullet that 100xs storage capacity and 1 petabyte storage becomes commonplace, forcing Apple to get with the times."
2025-02-23T14:19:48Z,The Mac Mini is a terrible smartphone

2025-02-23T16:03:49Z,"I don't really want to give Apple too much credit, but (finally) bumping all Macs to 16GB of RAM massively improves the value proposition. M2 Air with 16GB RAM for $999 is really good value. But the M4 Mac mini is something else, I've been recommending it to everybody. I might buy one soon for myself even though I don't need one lmao. I don't think Apple will release a product that good with a price that good anytime soon."
2025-02-23T17:02:39Z,"oh man when that base model went on sale for $100 off at Costco, I grabbed an external SSD, put MacOS on it, and upgraded my boomer parents immediately. One of the best value computing purchases ever."
2025-02-23T20:12:04Z,"Yeah it felt like Apple might finally be re-embracing the ""not cheap, but sensibly priced"" end of the market with the Mac Mini of the last few generations

I was hoping they would commit to it more with a new MacBook - I LOVED my Unibody Polycarbonate MacBook and I thought it was an excellent entry point to Mac back in the day that has been missing for a long time. An ¬£800 MacBook base model would be great for that same role of introducing people to the ecosystem if they don't use a desktop

But the 16E rather than a proper SE suggests they're moving back away from that, which is a shame

Perhaps they'll take a different approach for MacBooks, but Apple tend to follow a single strategy so I'm not overly hopeful."

2025-02-23T13:33:06Z,Accept the fact that the current e-series is used to entice y‚Äôall to get the regular iPhone
2025-02-23T15:58:59Z,My thoughts exactly! This thing makes the regular iPhone 16 look like a much better deal.
2025-02-23T18:26:17Z,I actually felt the opposite way. People who don't care about tech specs will see the vast majority of what they need in the 16e and those who do will continue to buy the Pro because it is kind of silly to spend the money to but a brand new model and not get all the features.
2025-02-23T20:42:44Z,"I'm a little surprised by the outrage.

I remember when the iPhone XR came out and the tech press really weren't impressed, LCD screen? Bigger bezels? Just get the Pro. 

But the consumers loved it and most people bought it, and it had better battery life than the pro.

The 16e is actually priced lower than the XR was 5 years ago, only it doesn't have the compromise of the LCD screen or bigger bezels, its just cheaper.

For most people there is nothing the 16 does that the 16e can't. I think they'll pick the cheaper phone."
2025-02-24T06:31:25Z,"Thats the whole thing. There are a LOT of people who just want an iPhone and dont wanna spend ""iphone"" money. Most people arent looking at tech specs or any of this. ""Is it an iphone? Does it plug in and charge? Does it charge wirelessly too? Is the camera good enough? Is it cheaper?"". The answer is yes. I personally dont know if I really want the 16e. Its still a higher price than I would want. I feel id rather go 1-2 generation old pro max's for a bigger screen, seeing as how that performance would be good enough for me anyways. But for someone who isnt into tech specs and is on a contract, they walk into a phone store and say ""Oh hey. This iphone is cheaper. But its still a new iphone? Okay lets go"". The tiny, bad battery second gen SE was a hit for a reason"
2025-02-24T07:25:46Z,"&gt;I feel id rather go 1-2 generation old pro max's for a bigger screen, seeing as how that performance would be good enough for me anyways.

Ideally yes, but given how many shady second hand sellers there are out there, I can absolutely see the appeal of getting a brand new and still very good phone, rather than a potentially great older phone, where you can‚Äôt be certain all the parts are what they‚Äôre supposed to be, with a battery that will likely need to be replaced, making them the same price, in the end."
2025-02-24T11:55:01Z,"Thats the reason I havent bought used really. If both were the same price, screen size would be the deciding factor. I am ready for a 6.7ish inch display. The iphone se was awfully small. My current pixel 8a is better but still, i want bigger. I could settle for the 16e but... Yeah. Would getting a 14 Pro max new be worth it? I seem to recall services like straight talk selling older iphones"
2025-02-24T01:09:53Z,"As per usual, Reddit is an echo chamber for people who care more than usual, and typically with technical background.  

Most people I‚Äôve met that aren‚Äôt in tech simply don‚Äôt give half a flying fuck - they just want a working iPhone. Wireless charging, 3 cameras, it‚Äôs all novelty to them; they just need text, insta, call, and maybe a few more apps. A lot of people will just buy the cheapest model because they don‚Äôt care. Literally as recently as 2020, I knew people who actively chose to buy the XR - they just don‚Äôt care. It pretty much comes down to it‚Äôs the cheapest one + iPhone is an iPhone. 

The 16e will sell fine and people here will have a shocked pikachu face."
2025-02-24T04:29:36Z,I‚Äôve still got a 12 pro and this is the first time I‚Äôve been like ‚Äúoh that may actually be worth spending some cash to upgrade to

2025-02-23T19:51:27Z,"Primary driving upgrade is the camera, she wants to make sure her photos of her grandkids are the best possible. Apple Intelligence, and the OLED screen, face ID, kinda make it a worthwhile upgrade."
2025-02-24T08:52:45Z,"You can get much better camera capabilities and an even better display on an older iPhone, such as the 14 Pro, currently available online for less than the 16e‚Äôs list price. I struggle to imagine your mother cares so much about Apple intelligence‚Ä¶"

2025-02-23T13:23:51Z,"Apple only ever produced 3 iPhone SEs didn‚Äôt they? So they weren‚Äôt really entrenched in the market, but it‚Äôs still unfortunate to see that people at that budget level no longer have that option. Being under $500 was a pretty big selling point. I‚Äôm mainly interested in seeing how the C1 chip performs. Presumably they wouldn‚Äôt use it if it weren‚Äôt ready, but real world use is very different from in house testing. I do have faith though"
2025-02-23T14:54:32Z,"The 5C can also be considered a budget option, I suppose"
2025-02-23T15:31:34Z,Wasn‚Äôt the XR considered a budget option too?
2025-02-23T17:48:18Z,"It's a budget option to the same extent that the 8, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16 were budget options to their $999 contemporaries. These were about $200-$300 cheaper than their Pro equivalents,  but these were just the standard iPhones sold to consumers when they launched, and still weren't cheap.

The XR was $749, which firmly puts into the premium category as far general phone pricing goes. Sure, it was missing a camera and a had an LCD instead of an OLED like its $999 contemporary, but the same can be said about the 8 and 11, and those phones were even cheaper at launch than the XR."
2025-02-24T00:58:48Z,I don‚Äôt understand the people who say the XR was the cheap phone. Were they not paying attention one year earlier when the 8 was released? Or one year later when the 11 was released at 50 USD cheaper than the Xr??
2025-02-23T17:19:12Z,"The XR was the regular phone, while the XS was basically the Pro model."
2025-02-23T16:01:03Z,"Sort of. In most years, when a new iPhone is released, the previous model stays available at a reduced price. For that year, they got rid of the iPhone 5 entirely and gave us the 5C, which was just an iPhone 5 with a plastic shell."
2025-02-23T16:06:29Z,My bullshit alarm went off when I saw the iPhone 14 get discontinued at the same time the 16E released

That‚Äôs a slightly misleading way of looking at it.  Those three SEs spanned nearly a decade, and no one looking at the SEs cared about if they got refreshed each year or not.  

I know a lot of older people who have sworn by them for about as long.

Granted more for the home button than the price, but still, for the first time since the late Obama administration price and affordability is now going to be a big issue when it comes time to upgrading their phone."
2025-02-23T15:21:30Z,"&gt; no one looking at the SEs cared about if they got refreshed each year or not

If anything that was a plus for the enterprise market which was where a lot of SEs were sold."
2025-02-24T01:06:38Z,"I for one like small screens. I have been enjoying the SE and Mini lineups.

2025-02-23T19:56:18Z,"They're dragging their heels with OLED on the Macbooks and high refresh rate on the Airs. Most other premium laptops have had these things for 5 years now. 

Also I know most people don't play games on Macbooks but somehow they chose the worst possible displays for them for that purpose. They have high pixel density and all (altho by default that's disabled), but the response time is LAUGHABLY bad, like it legitimately is worse than 10 year old monitors."

‚ÄúApple Adjusts Pricing in Uncertain Tariff Import Market‚Äù

Economists have been saying for months that the new US administration and its reactionary tariffs are going to make everything coming from China more expensive. 

https://appleinsider.com/articles/25/02/20/bank-of-america-says-tariffs-could-raise-iphone-prices-by-nearly-10

And since USD is Apple‚Äôs global reference price it cascades out from there. 

(Don‚Äôt bother saying they could absorb the tariffs - Apple is a for profit company and taking a 20% margin cut voluntarily isn‚Äôt fiscally responsible to the shareholders)"
2025-02-23T17:56:45Z,They don‚Äôt really have to price in tariffs for every other region in the world though‚Ä¶ not sure that adds up for me. Inflation is a much more universal answer here.
2025-02-24T00:11:04Z,"Both are true - Apple‚Äôs reference price globally is USD and they adjust from there to local currency. 

They don‚Äôt go to the lowest prices possible in each region partially to avoid an arbitrage scenario where smartphones in market X are way cheaper than in market U (taking into account currency conversion) and setting up a big import market."
2025-02-24T14:31:54Z,"typically over 40% of apple's profits come from the US

2025-02-23T18:20:02Z,"Yes obviously people who just buy the cheapest phone will absolutely still get the 16e regardless, but the value complaints come from the fact that the previous cheapest iPhone as $429 and the 16e is $599.

2025-02-23T13:24:41Z,"2016's $399 adjusted for inflation is $528.¬†

Their budget phone didn‚Äôt get that much more expensive, gets the same soc as the regular phones and will probably be good and fast for 5-6 years.¬†

2025-02-23T14:00:47Z,"But phones don't live on a vacuum. There's a reason the title talks about ""budget smartphone market"".

Today you have $400 Android phones that are significantly more capable than whatever you had in 2016 at that price point.

That's what defines the budget market, not inflation, or which is Apple's cheapest option.

In the US for example you get massive deals for Samsung or Google, which puts their flagships at the same price or lower than the 16e as well. And that's ignoring previous year flagships, including Apple's own iPhone 15.

In some other regions, like in Europe, the price makes even less sense. It costs the same as an S24 Ultra when you match the ssd capacity (or $100 less if you don't).

So no, it's not a budget anymore even if it's within inflation, because on the market you have a ton of alternatives for that price or lower.

It should go without saying, that if you are limiting yourself to Apple, then sure, whichever has the lowest cost is gonna be the ""budget"" version. But then again that would be like saying whichever is the cheapest Ferrari is a budget car, which it obviously isn't."
2025-02-23T17:07:21Z,"To be fair, ever since the smartphone market began, you were ALWAYS able to find better specced hardware at a lower cost than Apple.¬†

Apple has never been the budget option. They‚Äôve always priced their products at a higher premium than Androids.¬†"
2025-02-23T19:11:46Z,"I don't think iPhones compete directly with Android phones though.

Most people on each side refuse to switch to the other side. It's a pain in the ass. You have to re-buy apps, migrate your data; it's a clusterfuck.

In order for people to switch platforms it has to be an AMAZING deal on an AMAZING device. 

I know I wouldn't switch to Android personally unless iPhones REALLY started to suck, and it would have to be epic levels of suckage because I simply trust Google a lot less than Apple."
2025-02-23T17:04:31Z,The average iphone buyer isn't comparing their phone to an Android phone. They don't care.
2025-02-23T14:33:57Z,People's incomes didn't raise that high but it seems that prices go up. That's really all it is. Coupled with the fact it's reddit and the internet is a microcosm of reality
2025-02-23T13:37:51Z,"2016‚Äôs SE is not the one you should be using as an argument, previous gen (2022) SE is a much better comparison and shows, even adjusting for inflation, that the new 16e is not a ‚Äúbudget‚Äù phone anymore."
2025-02-23T13:42:40Z,"Adjusting for inflation doesn't make sense for phones when the cost of tech tends to come down, not go up. iPhone 3G was $1043 adjusted for inflation. iPhone 16 is $799."
2025-02-23T14:50:07Z,"It makes sense because us normal folk have other necessities to spend money on, and those necessities tend to track with inflation."
2025-02-23T13:51:48Z,"&gt;Some people just use the internet to complain.

And that‚Äôs good. If no one ever complained we‚Äôd all be getting shafted 100% of the time. People need to pick this shit apart and lay it all out on the table. It‚Äôs healthy and good for all of us.

2025-02-23T19:45:42Z,"That‚Äôs not how things work. They deliver more at the same cost, they don‚Äôt try to find ways to make things cheaper."
2025-02-23T15:46:05Z,"BC people don‚Äôt understand the world is getting more and more expensive on purpose, and the prices aren‚Äôt going to come back down. The really neat thing is it‚Äôs going to keep happening while most folks wages won‚Äôt even kind of increase at the same rate. ü•≤"
2025-02-23T13:46:00Z,"Given we're talking about the market, did the rest of the budget smartphone market inflation adjust up? Meaning you can't find a 399 phone anymore?"
2025-02-23T14:57:19Z,"No, inflation is just Reddit‚Äôs favorite argument to use against poor people when we talk about not being able to afford anything anymore. Ignoring the fact that wages haven‚Äôt kept up and that everything has gotten more expensive on top of it. ‚ÄúInflation‚Äù or not"
2025-02-23T16:51:17Z,"Also, and I know this is controversial, maybe a company worth 3.69 trillion dollars whose resource hoarding causes widespread suffering shouldn‚Äôt be let off the hook with the ‚Äúinflation‚Äù excuse in the same way a mom and pop shop might? ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
2025-02-23T15:08:18Z,I‚Äôm gonna bet that the 16e will tick down in price once the 17 lineup is out and sold through its initial wave.
2025-02-23T16:49:05Z,"For what it's worth, at least the first gen SE didn't omit any features compared to the 5S it was based on. This phone drops a bunch features compared to even the iPhone 11, let alone the 12.

No ultrawide, no magsafe, no precision finding, is just cheap."
2025-02-23T15:56:14Z,"Inflation is not a great measurement for the value when most tech and electronics in general have been largely unaffected by inflation. Game consoles, headphones, tablets, home appliances, smart home tech, all sorts of things are still the same price as they were 6-7 years ago with very few exceptions. Even the mainline iPhones have been mostly the same price for years. The budget iPhone being eliminated in favor of a phone they'll pretend is a budget iPhone just to get people to go ahead and get the normal iPhone just sucks for people who were fine with what they offered before."
2025-02-23T19:21:15Z,Fuckin paywall for the article man‚Ä¶
2025-02-23T19:01:22Z,Anyone able to read the articles?
2025-02-23T15:20:09Z,"If you want a budget smartphone, just get a used one.  There are plenty of great phones out there.  My home cell is still a 12 pro max and I love it."
2025-02-23T13:37:18Z,"16e is a loser. I was ready for a new ‚Äúcompact‚Äù phone myself, I‚Äôm not even trying to save money so the price point isn‚Äôt even the killer, though they simultaneously with the 16e have turned away people looking for a budget iPhone, the people looking for a smaller phone AND the tech aware people. 

No Magsafe, no UWB, weird and diminished version of the A18 chip and it‚Äôs the same size as the 15/16. Who is this phone for?"
2025-02-23T13:44:18Z,"Someone that was on Iphone 12 or 13, that do not use all the new fancy things and just want new cheapest iphone that uses USB-C because their friends starting to use USB-C and they cannot borrow charger anymore."
2025-02-23T13:49:22Z,"Iphone 11 user here. I just purchased the 16E a couple days ago. Straight talk had a deal for $360 plus you get $300 worth of additional credits if you upgrade your data plan. I never use magsafe of UWB. I had to google to even see that those features were so I don't think I am going to miss them. I'm just happy I won't to worry about damned lightning cables anymore. I never did have much luck with them.

Plus my battery is in the high 60%. I felt like it was time"
2025-02-23T16:18:17Z,I‚Äôm exactly in the situation; did the same thing and got the straight talk deal. I‚Äôm most excited to ditch the lightning charger because it is just so finicky.
2025-02-23T17:35:48Z,"Xfinity did a similar thing - I‚Äôm getting mine for $300.00 and pretty stoked about it. 

Not sure where all this ‚ÄúNo one wants this phone‚Äù is coming from"
2025-02-23T13:48:52Z,"Most people also use cases for their phones. The iPhone 16e does have wireless charging, just not MagSafe. With a case with built in magnets, you‚Äôll get wireless charging again, albeit at a reduced level."
2025-02-23T13:52:31Z,"Also, my thinking is that most ppl who buy cheapest iphone and try to rarely replace their phone.... Probably also use case with their phone anyway. Only YT influencers whose job is to review phones and only need to use their phone for a year before upgrading, can sorta afford to go ""naked"". Those ppl (who buy 16e) also probably does not really care about wireless charging speed."
2025-02-23T14:01:13Z,"Agreed. I rarely see people out, or at work, rawdogging a phone. They‚Äôre too expensive and it is an inconvenience to repair or replace, even if you have insurance or Apple Care. 

I have an iPhone 16 Pro Max and the only time I will use wireless charging is in my car, as I bought a Qi2 mount specifically for it. Before that, I was plugging a cable into my phone with a normal mount. If I didn‚Äôt buy this phone, I would probably still be using the old mount. MagSafe wasn‚Äôt even in the realm of reasoning as to why I bought this phone. 

I still charge my phone with a USB-C cable every night and I don‚Äôt intend to stop doing that."
2025-02-23T14:27:57Z,"For a more minimalist iPhone user the 16e is probably going to tick a lot of boxes for those coming from a 12 or earlier. This is kind of like the modern iPhone XR. If the 16e was going to be a battery beast like that one was I‚Äôd ditch my pro and run for it. Lack of MagSafe is the bummer though, I do enjoy my Anker maggo 10k slim‚Äôs 15w wireless charging"
2025-02-23T14:18:57Z,"Agree. A 13 mini shell would have been very good. Keep the same cameras, upgrade to USB-C, upgrade to a processor capable of Apple Intelligence (presume the A17 Pro would be cheaper than the A18 to put in there), and you have yourself a cheaper phone than the 16e. Would have been really good... Oh well."
2025-02-23T14:03:43Z,It‚Äôs for Apple.  To test the modem out with users who won‚Äôt know the difference or make a big stink about it on social media.
2025-02-23T13:52:31Z,"I got excited when I first heard about this thinking it would be the return of the Mini with a different name, but nope. Just a nerfed 16. Why can't they just put those specs in a smaller package üò≠"
2025-02-23T17:41:19Z,Had my fingers crossed for some sort of un-rumored surprise. Time to get the battery replaced in my 13 mini instead.
2025-02-23T13:25:42Z,If they'd meant it to be a budget phone they'd've named it the 15.99e
2025-02-24T02:29:48Z,"So if this new phone isn‚Äôt an SE, isn‚Äôt a small phone, isn‚Äôt a budget phone

Well could there be room for an actual SE or Mini later on?"
2025-02-24T09:44:29Z,"It felt like they completely missed the point with this product, they should‚Äôve just dramatically slashed the prize on the iPhone 14 with a new chipset. Instead they raise the price, design a new phone and took out a bunch of features that are pretty critical for most people."
2025-02-23T20:50:23Z,Most carriers will offer the phone for free but I‚Äôm scratching my head why no MagSafe
2025-02-24T00:41:08Z,They can‚Äôt. Apple was sued over it as some other company owns the patent
2025-02-24T02:07:02Z,"&gt;They can‚Äôt. Apple was sued over it as some other company owns the patent

That's not true.  Mirror Worlds LLC sued Apple for the interfaces in Cover Flow, Time Machine and Spotlight and won $625 million in damages in 2010.  However, that was overturned in 2011

Apple continued to offer Cover Flow on the iPhone until iOS 8 (2014) and the Mac until Mojave (2018) and continues to use interface features it was sued for elsewhere.

They phased out Cover Flow mostly because, well... it sucked.  It was extremely flashy and was great for demos, but as libraries got larger and displays did to, it was just really inefficient, both from a user perspective and from the resources necessary to display.

Still IMHO, I'd like to see Apple Music do *something* in horizontal mode, ideally giving it feature parity with the desktop app.

EDIT: $625 *million*"
2025-02-24T00:59:49Z,"Patent.  If it were just a trademark, Apple could call it something else."
2025-02-24T01:56:45Z,The patent appears to be expired though?
2025-02-24T03:35:27Z,Perhaps.  It wouldn't surprise me.  But I'm not about to do a patent search to find out.
2025-02-24T00:42:09Z,Wow. My heart is broken but thank you for letting me know
2025-02-24T15:47:06Z,"Was that also for the cover ""wall"" that was in iOS 7? Or just the original coverflow from iOS 6 and before?"
2025-02-23T23:53:16Z,"I feel like Cover Flow would be a nightmare in the age of streaming. Our libraries are mammoth compared to back then. 

That being said I lived it back then as a ‚Äúlook at this cool thing my computer/iPod can do‚Äù feature."
2025-02-23T23:54:12Z,Why would it be a nightmare?
2025-02-23T23:58:24Z,"Cause it would be ages of swipe, swipe, swipe, swipe with our larger libraries."
2025-02-24T01:58:04Z,"I think it would be reasonable to set a playlist as a Cover Flow with a limit on the amount of songs. But, Apple isn‚Äôt licensing the technology. I do love that on my old iPod Classic."
2025-02-24T00:03:34Z,Maybe or maybe they‚Äôll perfect the swipe speed somehow. I‚Äôm not saying this is the most efficient method. I‚Äôm just saying it was cool and I often listen to multiple songs off an album if not the whole project at a time. This is a more leisurely way to experience music in addition to being in landscape. If you just want to hear whatever there‚Äôs other methods.
2025-02-24T00:12:14Z,Literally explained it in the comment you responded to.
2025-02-24T05:10:18Z,Especially since the horizontal landscape isn‚Äôt doing anything anyway. Not like they have to restructure any of the UI elements.
2025-02-24T01:06:13Z,I suspect Cover Flow is resurrected in some form for their new HomePad/Homepod with a Screen device rumoured to be coming out soon
2025-02-24T01:34:09Z,That would make a lot of sense but another user said they don‚Äôt own the rights to Cover Flow
2025-02-24T08:40:08Z,Bring back visualiser.
2025-02-24T13:25:49Z,That too !
2025-02-24T09:23:06Z,"I have a (maybe weird) thing where, when I‚Äôm expecting something to scroll, my eyes kind of ‚Äòjump ahead‚Äô or blank out until  that thing is done scrolling. Hard to describe, but  CoverFlow triggered this big time - I hated it! üòÄ"
2025-02-24T13:29:45Z,I hate that for you
2025-02-24T10:59:56Z,"Forget Cover Flow, bring back that feature where you could select one song in your library * and it would built a smart playlist of 25 songs around that based on era, genre, tempo etc, bringing in songs in your own library

No need for a subscription, no fancy settings, it just worked.

And then they took it away and replaced with something else that was not as good

No, anything since that tries to replace/replicate this feature just isn't the same.

*Of your own music that you had ripped to iTunes, this pre-dates the Apple Music streaming service. I want it to ONLY work on my locally-stored music"
2025-02-24T13:27:57Z,The in ‚ôæÔ∏è works just fine for me but I feel you. Most of the fun is in the search for  new music anyway imo
2025-02-24T17:11:16Z,"Cover flow made me force rotation lock on because the device became basically unusable. 

I add individual songs, not full albums. I don‚Äôt need to scroll through a list of hundreds of album covers that are each one song."
2025-02-24T00:35:07Z,No thx. Also a TON of people don't use Apple Music and stick to Spotify
2025-02-24T00:40:09Z,I‚Äôm not worried ab people that use an inferior streaming app. I‚Äôm worried ab Cover Flow making a comeback.
2025-02-24T00:45:41Z,Lmao
2025-02-24T12:25:29Z,"so, youre saying that a company that actively killed their hardware from its start (and suggested to trash the devices) and the company that has the crappiest sound quality imaginable offers the better service?"
2025-02-24T01:10:47Z,"Good thing what Spotify does or doesn‚Äôt do has no relevance to this post about what OP wants the Apple Music app to do‚Ä¶in the Apple subreddit. 

I will never understand people like you who have to interject a largely irrelevant point just to try and take a jab at some internet stranger. Is your life *truly* so boring that this is how you get your rocks off? Jesus."
2025-02-24T01:15:30Z,Guy probably has posters of Daniel Eck hanging in his room
2025-02-23T08:32:16Z,Was unrealistically hoping for Claude.
2025-02-23T08:56:51Z,I expect it will be a fairly open integration that Claude will be able to implement.
2025-02-23T10:18:30Z,"What? No I wouldn‚Äôt expect that. Not for a long time anyway. Apple not going to give up control like that unless some government forces them. They had to get forced to put USB-C ports on phones, don‚Äôt forget.

Geez, on Safari, you can‚Äôt set an arbitrary search engine after 18 years, so I can‚Äôt tell it to use Kagi without jumping through hoops."
2025-02-23T12:37:15Z,"Apple literally described plans for ‚Äúand companies can add their own, such as a doctor referencing their local AI to work on patient data‚Äù

It‚Äôs a plug-in system."
2025-02-23T17:28:48Z,"They have to to comply with the EU‚Äôs DMA. This is why Apple Intelligence is not available yet in the EU, it not compliant because it doesn‚Äôt let you pick which AI provider you want to use."
2025-02-23T11:58:01Z,"Apple had a vested financial interest in keeping Lightning via their made for iOS designation, and lightning has some minor advantages over USBC (not all by a long shot, but a few) so it wasn‚Äôt strictly an upgrade.

Anyway, likely being proactive here because they see the monetary value in allowing for more models before something like the EU tries to force the issue."
2025-02-24T03:11:59Z,"I love Kagi. I agree, and it‚Äôs frustrating, but the Kagi browser extension does make it rather seamless."
2025-02-23T19:28:31Z,iClaude
2025-02-23T10:42:53Z,But now you can give all your information to Google... I think Apple Intelligence is a hard pass for me.
2025-02-23T10:46:04Z,"I'd only consider using Claude or Le Chat right now. I know there should be more options out there though. ChatGPT and Gemini just don't work for me. And about Apple Intelligence - you can use it without the integration, but it's pretty underwhelming honestly. The notifications are decent and Genmoji is fun, but everything else? Meh. If I need something I'll just use a regular app - what's the point of going through Siri?"
2025-02-23T12:39:59Z,"It‚Äôs only the (trivia?) queries that you want to send to Gemini. And it asks first before it sends any of those. 

It takes over for the ‚Äúhmm here‚Äôs some information from the web‚Äù messages."
2025-02-23T13:09:57Z,"Google already has all of your information, as does Meta. It‚Äôs definitely a problem, but in today‚Äôs digital world where data can be traded at the speed of light, everything about you is available everywhere unless you choose a fully disconnected life."
2025-02-23T19:34:20Z,"While you‚Äôre right, it‚Äôs best to deter it as much as possible. Kind of like security or a door lock, it won‚Äôt stop someone from coming in but you can try to do something about it. Better than giving in to it."
2025-02-23T08:52:57Z,The integration with ChatGPT was pegged so meh.
2025-02-23T19:31:41Z,The ChatGPT integration is useless. Tell me why I‚Äôd want to use Siri to trigger ChatGPT when I could A.) already do that with a simple shortcut or B.) open the app directly so I can continue a chat while doing other things on my phone instead of having to keep Siri activated? I don‚Äôt get it.
2025-02-23T20:56:02Z,"It also literally does not get any context. I just asked Siri something and it responded with a Google search (which is literally fucking useless and I‚Äôm so sick of it even doing it) and instead, I said ask ChatGPT that. And it responded after a long wait for ChatGPT searching by ‚Äú I can‚Äôt search things‚Äù literally no context about what I was just talking about

I have to just accept that Siri and iOS is absolute dog shit at this point"
2025-02-23T20:28:15Z,"I use my action button for ChatGPT voice. What I don‚Äôt understand is when I get a response from Siri, I can‚Äôt even read the whole thing before it disappears."
2025-02-23T18:02:32Z,They said ‚Äúpegged‚Äù haha
2025-02-23T08:25:48Z,"I‚Äôm expected this for quite a while now because Apple isn‚Äôt really close to providing a good world knowledge model right now so they‚Äôre just outsourcing it they started with ChatGPT, Alibaba seems to be their partner in China and Gemini will probably be available eventually. That way, Apple avoids the contentious AI stuff. Like when people ask if X conflict was a genocide or the like."
2025-02-23T09:13:28Z,"Then they should let us map the Siri button straight to the third party platform of choice, and be done with Siri."
2025-02-23T12:41:20Z,Siri is needed for local controls. Just hit the button that says ‚Äúask ChatGPT without confirmation‚Äù
2025-02-23T09:33:21Z,I would prefer they keep Siri as the first contact and she continues to pass the mic when necessary. I don‚Äôt want everything to drop into Gemini or gpt by default.
2025-02-23T10:07:38Z,Do you understand the concept of choice?
2025-02-23T10:16:38Z,Most apple buyers dont
2025-02-23T21:53:43Z,And they'll argue tooth and nail against choice too.
2025-02-23T12:32:41Z,You could leave it (siri) as is or skip it so the mapping option is better imo
2025-02-23T19:37:43Z,"You just described the Action Button. As far as Siri is concerned, if you mapped it to ChatGPT it has no idea how to call someone or get directions. Right now the best way around this is Siri handles local on-device commands and anything else your choice of LLM will take over.

Samsung does this already with Gemini integration."
2025-02-23T21:44:29Z,The point is to have Siri be the interface and all of these services fighting to be the answer source.
2025-02-24T01:13:31Z,Like Perplexity.
2025-02-23T15:41:46Z,"I actually think Apple is smart for just ‚Äúleasing‚Äù AI like this. Gemini is just the latest option since It‚Äôs in too an infantile state right now. Let others fight out the kinks and waste money on R&amp;D, see if there is a company to take over or get to a position to develop in-house. In the interim get marketing to sell it to the sheep."
2025-02-23T19:01:00Z,"Why would you say that Gemini is in an infantile state? Their latest Flash model is superb and one of the best options out there if you‚Äôre looking for a solution that‚Äôs hitting a sweet spot between price and performance.

For generic stuff, almost any modern AI will do. For multi-modality, it‚Äôs surprisingly good. For actual language support, it‚Äôs top-tier."
2025-02-23T10:29:12Z,I just want their clean-up tool to rival Samsung's Generative Fill. Used it over the weekend and was blown away. Best I've used.
2025-02-23T14:20:57Z,"This is what private cloud compute is intended to offer. The on-device models are small so the results will be not always great. But once PCC is up and running, you‚Äôre supposed to be able to use the much more powerful models that can‚Äôt be stored on device."
2025-02-23T19:00:11Z,"There‚Äôs barely 3 to 4 months until the next iOS comes out. 

&gt;	But once PCC is up and running, you‚Äôre supposed to be able to use the much more powerful models that can‚Äôt be stored on device

It‚Äôs disappointing how badly they‚Äôve dropped the ball."
2025-02-23T19:23:59Z,"I think everyone agrees that Apple has objectively messed up their AI rollout and should have waited for iOS 19.

On top of the gap between features, and delaying of features people would actually like, they‚Äôve also made it confusing. The sheer number of times, even in this very thread, that people think Siri ‚Äúis just ChatGPT now‚Äù is a sign that Apple has poorly communicated their AI stack, and that tech journalists have exacerbated things with misleading headlines."
2025-02-24T03:36:47Z,Or at least had a realistic division of the features between iOS18 and iOS19. They caved to the Wall Street pressure that was begging for AI ASAP.
2025-02-23T13:53:36Z,Isn‚Äôt it the same on google photos app?
2025-02-23T18:57:05Z,"Probably, it uses Imagen 3 AFAIK"
2025-02-23T09:07:00Z,Just don‚Äôt ask it recommendations for depression. The Golden Gate Bridge might get mentioned.
2025-02-23T08:39:53Z,"Can somebody explain to me why apple, the billion dollar company which is struggling to enter the ai game, isnt just buying a start up company that already has a working team and product? 

Isnt that how they did it with shazam or what microsoft did with skype? 
Am i missing something?"
2025-02-23T08:45:09Z,"Because there‚Äôs probably no advantage to Apple training and developing their own LLM that could compete with ChatGPT or Gemini or DeepSeek right now. Apple were caught out with LLMs and letting users plug their own choice. 

This also sidesteps antitrust allegations and concerns about data used to train models (eg licensing or scraping). Seems like Apple have decided it isn‚Äôt worth it just how, but also acknowledges that people (apparently?) expect these features (or maybe more accurately, shareholders expect it)."
2025-02-23T09:00:47Z,"I mean yeah even the companies training them often aren't really getting an advantage. A lot of companies and investors are investing in AI hoping *eventually* that it'll show them some path to profit. In the meantime, a lot of them are absolutely *shedding* cash building and running these models."
2025-02-23T09:05:44Z,"You are probably right and they are 100% doing this for the shareholders. 
But if they buy an existing LLM that already has a following like perplexity, phind, MathGPT etc it would give apple the edge of system integrated exclusivity. Since most students already use ipads it would make them more likely to use the AI that is on their device, wouldnt it?"
2025-02-23T14:09:37Z,"Apple has bought AI companies, AI has been Apples biggest acquisition center since before covid. The reason they don't just buy a model and the team behind it is that a) they have; but the real answer is that current LLMs fail to solve the problem Apple articulates in an acceptable manner. Apple would rather not have an LLM than have an LLM that is confidently wrong and damages their brand. (please dont 'ha gotcha, siri already damages the brand' nobody doesnt know that)"
2025-02-23T14:35:50Z,"Nonsense, remember Apple Maps? Didn‚Äôt damage the brand and they didn‚Äôt care about releasing it in the state it was in. The existing Apple Intelligence features also get things wrong and aren‚Äôt very useful, but they launched that too. 

Apple just haven‚Äôt figured it out, simple as that."
2025-02-23T21:17:33Z,I imagine Apple would rather have the media report ‚ÄúApple Intelligence features aren‚Äôt great‚Äù rather than ‚ÄúApple Intelligence told me to put rocks on my pizza‚Äù
2025-02-23T22:31:02Z,"Also, are the people who are defending Apple in this case forgetting that Siri still sucks? 

I find one of the most useful features of AI is that they are able to understand language and accents very well. So why isn't that being implemented into Siri?"
2025-02-23T09:01:49Z,"You bring up DeepSeek but that‚Äôs literally the example that disproves your own point. With enough willpower and engineering, Apple could make a top end model for less than $10,000,000 *like DeepSeek has already proven is possible* 

Then they don‚Äôt have to spend millions paying other companies for access, and the privacy concerns of handing off data to third parties is eliminated entirely."
2025-02-23T09:43:05Z,"Apple can burn more than 10 billion on training. But it‚Äôs not about the training. It‚Äôs about everything else to do the training. Including buying the data, buying the ‚Äúright‚Äù data, the biases of the data‚Ä¶ Apple has bought services before which ended up with Apple Music.

I think Apple just wants nothing to do with determining facts. The user can choose what facts they want by choosing their choice of AI."
2025-02-23T13:28:30Z,"&gt; It‚Äôs about everything else to do the training. Including buying the data, buying the ‚Äúright‚Äù data, the biases of the data‚Ä¶

If we have learned _anything_ about the AI wars, is that when big companies steal data, it's all good. It's only normal people that get punished.

So they wouldn't need to worry at all, nothing would happen."
2025-02-23T13:30:45Z,"There‚Äôs a reason why Apple never was forced to be part of the ‚Äúculture wars‚Äù unlike Facebook and Google, they made the platform which other people‚Äôs content sit on. They simply don‚Äôt make content that forces them to ‚Äúdecide‚Äù unless of course it‚Äôs nudity or offensive."
2025-02-23T09:03:48Z,"It isn‚Äôt about money- Apple has money.

What was DeepSeek trained on?"
2025-02-23T08:55:42Z,Apple is a 3.7 Trillion dollar company
2025-02-23T15:28:57Z,That‚Äôs what they did with Siri.  And I think in some ways it was better then.  Also I hate to correct but I think you meant trillion dollar company.  They are a trillion dollar company that can‚Äôt seem to get in the game.  It‚Äôs crazy.
2025-02-23T16:27:19Z,"many reasons, but the simple answer:  

there is no clear winner in this space, and so overly rotating in any direction means apple may lose.  

i think they are trying to align themselves with clustered market leaders and enable functionality while continuing to work on their own solutions. apple does have some pretty good on-device models, just not llms."
2025-02-23T09:35:30Z,"The cost and data needed to train these frontier models is absurd, and while Apple could afford the cost, they lack the data companies like Microsoft, Google, xAI, and Meta possesses.

That data collection, as well as the scrapping of copyrighted IP that has been used to train these models, is highly controversial - as is the massive energy usage involved, so Apple are basically paying to keep their hands clean.

These models are also some of the fastest depreciating assets in the world. The second a model outperforms yours, there is zero incentive for anyone to use yours, and the switching cost to move from one to another is typically very low. This is particularly true if that new model is much cheaper or open source - and once the legal grey area around distillation is cleared up, the likelihood of that happening would grow massively. The cost to produce them just doesn't make financial sense anymore."
2025-02-23T09:50:38Z,"A few months ago they were actually supposed to be buying themselves a board seat and stake in OpenAI, but regulators prevented it.  Now all they can do is try to tax whatever does succeed."
2025-02-23T09:11:21Z,"you don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre developing in the background. large language models were just the beginning, this ai is just getting started"
2025-02-23T09:47:01Z,They‚Äôre actually a 3 trillion dollar company but whose counting
2025-02-23T21:54:47Z,Trillion dollar*
2025-02-23T10:44:39Z,"They don‚Äôt want you asking SiriLLM about Israel. But in all seriousness, even though they could just waste billions of dollars on LLMs, why even do it? ChatGPT gives itself for free, and that‚Äôs the best one apparently. They pay nothing, so why would they pay a lot instead? When this bubble comes crashing down, at least they won‚Äôt lose a lot, because AI investors already don‚Äôt have a lot of faith in them lmao"
2025-02-23T09:15:53Z,Roll out the shit you‚Äôve already promised before making even more promises.
2025-02-23T13:12:24Z,Where did Apple make a new commitment.
2025-02-23T14:05:04Z,"since they only read headlines, this headline makes no sense to them so they invent the details, instead of being a participant and reading the previous articles about these integrations"
2025-02-23T08:37:27Z,whatever happened to their chatgpt integration?
2025-02-23T08:40:05Z,It‚Äôs there. It‚Äôs just very limited in that it only uses the base model and it can‚Äôt search the web for you
2025-02-23T09:04:32Z,"I thought it leveraged the Plus subscription and also could automatically switch to ChatGPT.

I now asked about a recent event, and it managed to search for the info."
2025-02-23T09:12:11Z,Yeah it uses 4o and can use Search. I assume the person you‚Äôre replying to is referring to how you can‚Äôt use o1 or o3-mini. Obviously this limitation will cease to be relevant with the move to GPT-5.
2025-02-23T09:19:50Z,That came out a couple months ago already
2025-02-23T14:13:00Z,Apple intelligence is just a hook for other companies AI?
2025-02-23T16:33:07Z,"It is the third level. If it can't answer using on-device, it will go to private cloud or offer you a third party based on what you have set up."
2025-02-23T16:57:00Z,When will the private cloud be launched?
2025-02-23T11:02:17Z,Hopefully Apple is thinking about this in a way that allows them to swap out for the best LLM that is available that achieves their goals.
2025-02-23T13:27:50Z,Hopefully this opens up the same stuff you can do on Samsung like circle to search etc
2025-02-23T17:12:00Z,"Apple upgrade to MacOS 15.3 and it turns on Apple intelligence by default.

After disabling,

Apple upgrade to MacOS 15.3.1 and it turns on Apple Intelligence again!!

This is unfortunate and a dark tactic.  Microsoft has done this now for years but to see Apple adopt this is unfortunate."
2025-02-23T15:48:34Z,Will they kiss?
2025-02-23T11:09:04Z,"Wish they‚Äôd allow custom AI apis, so my home one would run"
2025-02-23T18:21:17Z,"Just when you thought Apple Intelligence couldn‚Äôt get more disappointing, we‚Äôve got one more thing"
2025-02-23T18:50:27Z,"From my experience, Chat GPT is not triggered every time I would expect it. I wish Siri became much smarter rather than Apple adding new third-party models. Especially from Google, since I don't trust this company regarding privacy."
2025-02-23T08:35:38Z,Apple intelligence -&gt; disable.
2025-02-23T20:37:14Z,Yeah I've never used Siri so Apple Intelligence won't do much for me...fyi there's also a button that turns off Apple Intelligence reports sent every 15 mins in the Privacy section.
2025-02-23T20:37:47Z,I know and disabled everything :)
2025-02-23T09:10:23Z,Hope Apple intelligence will stay opt in because I don‚Äôt buy Apple to have google invade like this.
2025-02-23T11:44:35Z,"Apple admitted that they would choose Google as the default search engine regardless of the money offered. By default, Apple lets Google into your phone because they‚Äôre the best at search. It‚Äôll be the same for AI. Apple offers the best to their customers and takes steps to protect our privacy (where legally allowed)."
2025-02-23T13:03:17Z,"It already flipped to opt out. Just upgrading  Mac to MacOS 15.3 enables Apple intelligence and also turns on Apple intelligence reporting at 15 min intervals.  Infuriating.  This new default also leaves Apple intelligence reporting on even after turning off Apple intelligence.  It has a separate toggle under privacy,  

#notcool"
2025-02-23T10:39:00Z,My point exactly. I don‚Äôt want google spywares anywhere near my phone.
2025-02-23T16:31:41Z,Then don't turn it on in Apple Intelligence; all third-party AI has to be turned on by the user before it will be offered as an option. And even then it will only ask you if Apple Intelligence can't awsner.
2025-02-23T14:41:25Z,I've used Gemini only once and I was not impressed.
2025-02-23T16:30:36Z,I don‚Äôt get why they want to do it themselves and not just provide API for 3rd party developer like for filesystem snapshots and cloud drivers.
2025-02-24T00:14:40Z,"Genuinely curious, what‚Äôs wrong with the current Chatgpt integration?"
2025-02-24T01:59:11Z,"Nope. 

There is no universe in which I would ever consider allowing anything built by Google or Meta this level of access to my personal info."
2025-02-24T02:22:16Z,"Tbh all I want is a better Siri. 

Apple can integrate these ai chatbots but they‚Äôre probably not going to deliver a better experience than the one I could get if I just opened these apps and used them. 

At least not until Apple is ready to quick playing around and make Siri something more than a joke."
2025-02-23T15:45:27Z,Eh well shit.  I‚Äôve been de-Googled for a while now.
2025-02-23T20:28:59Z,"Would really appreciate if they'd take privacy more seriously in so many ways. For AI integration, it seems trivial to provide users to enter their own endpoint for a self-hosted OpenAI solution. This is the only way i'd consider ""enabling"" apple's AI features."
2025-02-23T15:59:34Z,I guess they finally figured OpenAI has peaked a while ago. Google probably has the better multimodal models that actually enable products.
2025-02-23T08:35:48Z,[deleted]
2025-02-23T08:57:22Z,You find Gemini better than ChatGPT?
2025-02-23T09:13:02Z,the models on http://aistudio.google.com are quite good and way less censored than the gemini app models

2025-02-24T10:45:25Z,The US government is just a carcass being animated by a parasitic coalition of Big Tech
2025-02-23T23:29:54Z,"what does Facebook do ""research and development"" on besides new ways to steal and sell user data? if they're ""targeting"" US companies, it would only be because US is telling them they can do whatever they want however they want and there will only be finger-wagging in response to any line crossing, and in the EU, the people have rights, not just the corporations."
2025-02-24T06:21:15Z,"Many things. Way for people and companies to monetize intellectual property, ways to integrate the social network into in-demand services like dating or selling used stuff. And one important thing‚Ä¶ Have you ever heard of departments in the public sector going down due to a cyberattack? Or ransomware in quite large businesses? I have. Have you ever heard of Facebook going down due to a DDOS attack? No. They do a lot of research on resilient systems."
2025-02-24T10:14:36Z,"They don‚Äôt go down with a DDOS because they have tens of millions of servers in their data centers and hundreds of thousands installed in edge locations.

They‚Äôre just too big to DDOS, similar to cloudflare and how they can protect from a DDOS attack.

2025-02-23T23:43:02Z,"&gt; I hope European countries cut their (FB and others) tax-free benefits in response

there were already planning to do that with digital taxes, hence why US tech companies have lobbied Trump to threaten EU countries with tariff retaliation https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-says-he-will-impose-retaliatory-tariffs-digital-taxes-may-come-friday-2025-02-21/

2025-02-23T23:43:26Z,"Yeah, Apple is quite keen to keep DEI. It was originally built as colour and as a piece with Steve Jobs and Jonny Ive from what I‚Äôve read and Apple appears to be keeping its DEI around.

2025-02-23T23:31:41Z,I was there for WWDC. A lot of fun!
2025-02-23T13:51:13Z,A friend who works there told me they took it down. I don't know if it is coming back. They barely used it.
2025-02-23T19:53:50Z,"They are replacing it. It was getting super worn, and they want to replace it with a weather-proof version. There is a whole construction zone around it."
2025-02-23T14:27:03Z,"I mean for events it did look pretty cool and I saw it frequently during keynotes. If they take it down because they didn't use it I wouldn't mind.

It's just that the tech industry seems to have shifted to the right in the past months which is why I am worried this might have been an intentional move by Apple. Jonny Ive did say that the rainbow should express ""inclusion values"", which are not something the new government is very fond of.

Then again this could also very much be a coincidence, as Apple seems to be one of the few companies to stick to their values. Until they don't, i guess."
2025-02-23T16:21:33Z,"The rainbow stage was the old Apple colors, no? I don't think it had anything to do with LGBT colors? Someone correct me if I'm wrong but that's what I thought it was."
2025-02-23T18:45:36Z,Correct. It is apples old rainbow apple logo color scheme and color order.
2025-02-23T20:13:16Z,The stage was built LONG after Apple dropped the rainbow Apple logo.  It was intentionally a feature of Apple Park and will remain so when rebuilt.
2025-02-24T06:00:38Z,Apple likes to make occasional callbacks though. Such as the colours they chose for the M1 iMac redesign
2025-02-23T19:57:08Z,The feelings of the right don‚Äôt care about the facts of it being the Apple colours.
2025-02-23T20:52:13Z,They're such snowflakes lol
2025-02-23T16:42:10Z,"I never personally associated it with LGBT colors but in [this](https://9to5mac.com/2019/05/10/rainbow-stage/) interview Jonny Ive is talking about inclusion so it might have at least some kind of association?

Also, even if not intentional, the rainbow flag is the most prominent icon of the LGBT community which is why I think it could offend conservatives. Again, all just speculation but I find the timing of the removal odd."
2025-02-23T23:02:04Z,Cook is one of those most prominent gay CEOs in the world. I doubt after being gay all his life he‚Äôs deciding to be heterosexual now to appease the right.

2025-02-23T18:55:47Z,"The idea they would remove a stage that Trump has never seen, nor cared about, and that existed thorughout Trump's first administration to appease Trump is laughable. This is some serious TDS."
2025-02-23T21:07:18Z,You're reading way too much into things. It's being rebuilt into something more permanent. It was originally just something temporary.
2025-02-23T23:06:26Z,"I haven‚Äôt seen a rainbow in a while after it‚Äôs rained, has Donald Trump and the Right eliminated water vapor produced rainbows? Maybe Mother Nature and physics are trying to appease Trump!"

He said it was odd they didn‚Äôt take it down after and just assumed everyone wanted to keep it up even though it looked like it was a temporary thing not built to stand for a long time
2025-02-23T18:44:56Z,I highly doubt it was removed due to a political shift. That‚Äôs not their style.. they normally plant themselves on subjects like a tree.. chances are it was just under utilized and they found a better purpose for the space‚Ä¶ and if your wondering about planting themselves on subjects line a tree‚Ä¶ ‚Äúscreen notches and Dynamic Islands‚Äù anyone?
2025-02-24T00:17:40Z,"Tim cook was at a dinner with Trump.

Apple is a corporations they are not your friends

Apple would absolutely throw everything away if it made them more money"
2025-02-24T00:02:04Z,"Yeah, the current administration which appointed many gay individuals, features the first president to openly support gay marriage."
2025-02-23T19:23:04Z,Fuck the new government.
2025-02-23T19:16:13Z,"‚ÄúThe tech industry is shifting right! This is so unlike them!‚Äù

Tech is run by billionaires looking to sell the highest value product for the cheapest cost. They‚Äôve already ‚Äúcornered‚Äù their progressive audience, this ‚Äúshift‚Äù is just them finding ways to now sell to a conservative audience while also kissing the ring to make sure they can make even more money."
2025-02-23T23:46:37Z,"That‚Äôs just foolish. Firstly, Apple doesn‚Äôt sell its high-value products cheaply. Second, every rich Republican owns an iPhone. And finally, the stage is just gone temporarily. No one is kissing the ring with this stage."
2025-02-23T14:38:09Z,Interesting take. Maybe? I certainly wouldn't put it past Tim to tread lightly under the current administration. I have to think he has been attending the inauguration and other events under duress.
2025-02-23T22:26:09Z,Under duress‚Ä¶LOL
2025-02-23T18:26:37Z,"I mean he didn‚Äôt just attend it he donated $1 million to it, unfortunately all of these tech CEOs are going to go with whatever will help them and their company the most, which includes abandoning things they claimed to stand behind"
2025-02-23T19:43:01Z,"It is very, very normal for large companies to donate to inaugurations regardless of who is in office. I wouldn‚Äôt assume much from Cook‚Äôs and/or Apple‚Äôs donation.¬†"
2025-02-23T18:48:43Z,It is up to the workers to make a stand. Owners will never prioritize anything but money. Their principles change with the wind according to the political climate
2025-02-23T19:38:17Z,"Tbh Tim cook is a billionaire, using less than 0.1% to gain some good will among a very corrupt administration could be seen as a smart move."
2025-02-23T23:50:46Z,Indeed it‚Äôs a smart move. And Tim Cooke most definitely is a billionaire but he has pledged to give back all of his wealth.
2025-02-23T19:58:31Z,"Tim is a smart guy, he knows which way the wind is blowing and what his professional responsibilities are.

I‚Äôm not sure I would make the same choices, but that‚Äôs partly why I‚Äôm not a CEO."
2025-02-23T19:38:08Z,All playing ‚ÄûGood Germans‚Äú. And people wondered why and how all German including companies immediately started to tow the party line. Seems the USA isn‚Äôt so special.
2025-02-23T19:32:26Z,"Apple is good at pretending to have values. At the end of the day, they will do whatever makes them the most money.

As much as Reddit hates to admit it, public opinion has shifted. People have gotten tired of seeing the rainbow on everything."
2025-02-23T23:57:00Z,"People best get over being tired of the rainbow symbol as it isn‚Äôt going anywhere. We exist. We cannot be erased. Not L. Not G. Not B. Not T,. Regardless of where you allow us to fly our flags, we are born every day, everywhere, and will exist for as long as you do."
2025-02-23T20:17:59Z,They‚Äôre literally gonna put up a new one lol
2025-02-23T22:55:28Z,"I know, but that wasn't my point.

My point is that Apple isn't some sort of saintly corporation that can do no wrong."
2025-02-24T02:07:27Z,"Sure, but your comment was also implying that they were bringing the rainbow down due to those political reasons which is not correct"
2025-02-23T18:56:51Z,"I mean, I did a quick Google search out of curiosity and the first result gives the answer (and it was posted in 2019 when it was apparently first used):

*The Apple Stage will be dismantled after the event, but is designed for re-use, so will likely make future appearances at Apple‚Äôs Beer Bash events.*"
2025-02-23T20:55:05Z,"It‚Äôs disappointing that OP jumps to a conclusion, extends to political context, and comes to Reddit- all without a 1 second google."
2025-02-23T23:08:52Z,The media has people frothing at the mouth. It‚Äôs draining.
2025-02-24T01:45:29Z,in 2019 (im assuming for lady gaga or the killers) theyre most definitely referring to the stage platform and other supporting apparatus but not the arches themselves.
2025-02-23T21:11:38Z,"Amazed by the amount of brain rotten ppl here lol
The rainbow is torn down for reconstruction, and it‚Äôs never meant to be a permanent ‚Äúpublic‚Äù art anyways. Just that simple. Not everything is related to schemes or politics duh"
2025-02-23T23:12:32Z,There are reports of Trump and Musk being seen with wrenches personally dismantling it. Trump was stuck upside down in his harness and Secret Service had to get him down.
2025-02-24T03:56:38Z,"Stop spreading misinformation. They used drills and hammers to dismantle it, not wrenches. Tim Apple told me himself."
2025-02-24T04:10:45Z,"It was Don Lemon, with a hammer in the Apple garden."
2025-02-24T05:06:33Z,"Can confirm, I was the hammer"
2025-02-23T19:18:12Z,"As far as I was told by an old coworker that worked at Apple Park, it was put up for a lady gaga concert in like 2019 and somehow managed to stay up this whole time. I don't think it was permanent. But who know with how things are moving politically speaking."
2025-02-23T21:09:26Z,It's being replaced with a proper permanent stage. That's it. People like the OP are jumping to conclusions and deciding this is some kind of political statement when it's not.
2025-02-23T23:44:42Z,Makes sense. I‚Äôm surprised it stayed up as long as it did if it was a temporary stage. They probably planned on at least a few years. This is also apple and they like having shiny new things.
2025-02-24T12:00:41Z,I‚Äôm glad they are rebuilding it! It needed to be a bit more solid looking
2025-02-23T15:46:44Z,I think we all know why it‚Äôs no longer there.
2025-02-23T18:20:26Z,"A friend who works there told me that the original structure was designed to be temporary and was wearing out, so they are rebuilding it to be more permanent."
2025-02-23T18:45:28Z,That‚Äôs what I heard
2025-02-23T18:24:32Z,"Huh? You do realize that the ‚Äúrainbow‚Äù is nothing political or necessarily cultural right? It‚Äôs a nod the company‚Äôs history about ‚Äúbringing color to computing‚Äù at a time when everything else was very bulky, ugly, and bland. It also represents creativity &amp; diversity. It‚Äôs not that deep‚Ä¶"
2025-02-23T19:06:56Z,"Things are so politicized these days, and there‚Äôs a ton of virtue signaling in liberal areas. I just assumed it was the gay rainbow thing. I don‚Äôt care either way, but my guess is most people think of it as a cultural thing.

BTW, when Pink Floyd did their 50th anniversary promos for their Dark Side of the Moon album, some dweebs online accused them of being woke because of the prism, thinking it was the gay rainbow."
2025-02-23T21:57:37Z,"Next, they will politicize buying colorful iMacs."
2025-02-23T18:50:24Z,"Yea, I get that, however the current regime in the White House doesn‚Äôt understand nuance."
2025-02-23T19:28:20Z,The CEO is openly gay.
2025-02-23T19:29:33Z,I‚Äôm well aware. He also gave to Trump‚Äôs inauguration fund and attended the inauguration.
2025-02-23T19:36:55Z,"You think that the guy who has hosted many gay weddings at mar-a-lago is going to have a problem with a rainbow in Apple Park?

Reddit doesn‚Äôt understand nuance."
2025-02-23T19:40:03Z,Trump will do whatever someone that is currently giving him attention or money. Everyone that he has surrounded himself with are the ones railing against diversity and the LGBTQ community. Hence the ‚Äòregime‚Äô
2025-02-23T18:48:39Z,Yeah absolutely not. It has nothing to do with LGB. Its a representation of the OG Apple logo

2025-02-23T13:44:09Z,[deleted]
2025-02-23T14:11:08Z,Thanks for your concern.
2025-02-23T14:05:11Z,I mean. I think the real reason to feel bad is what‚Äôs actually happening
2025-02-23T14:10:37Z,I feel bad for people who are offended by refracted light
2025-02-24T01:17:28Z,lol.
2025-02-24T06:34:40Z,Okay in simplest terms. It‚Äôs business politics not personal politics.
2025-02-24T10:10:40Z,That was ugly¬†
2025-02-23T18:03:44Z,"Hi, very nice, but do you have more screenshots? What does it look like on carplay? Thanks"
2025-02-23T18:08:32Z,"It looks like this:

Apple CarPlay is very restrictive in what can be shown to reduce distractions but I think this works well."
2025-02-23T18:17:13Z,Ok cool. And what about EV stations? Does it show availability?
2025-02-23T18:19:08Z,"It does for US/Canada. It takes a couple seconds to load on the phone. I made many changes to EV mode so I can‚Äôt remember if availability is shown in CarPlay but I could add that!

I‚Äôll check in a few mins and update this comment

Edit: it does not show live status. I can add this if it's something you'd like to see!"
2025-02-23T17:36:12Z,are the fuel prices crowd sourced by the users?
2025-02-23T17:39:43Z,"If it‚Äôs the US/Canada it‚Äôs coming from GasBuddy so yes. I‚Äôd love to feed data back to them but still haven‚Äôt gotten a reply from them :/. It would also mean I‚Äôd have to collect data from my users and store it somewhere. Not sure I want to open that can of worms just yet. Keeping it simple for now. 

For UK, Germany there‚Äôs reliable ‚Äúofficial‚Äù sources.

Google maps and Waze have fuel pricing sometimes but near me it‚Äôs hilariously inaccurate. Perhaps I can add additional sources and display the most recent data ü§î"
2025-02-23T18:26:12Z,Didn‚Äôt know GasBuddy had an open api
2025-02-23T18:41:56Z,Their website uses GraphQL so you can fetch data that way.
2025-02-23T19:00:37Z,"Can you favorite certain gas stations, like Costco so it always shows up on top?"
2025-02-24T03:27:51Z,"Sneak peak at widget (via favouriting a station):

2025-02-23T19:03:58Z,You can filter by brand and it should remember those settings. I‚Äôm planning on making a widget where it‚Äôll show gas stations you favourite.
2025-02-23T19:05:32Z,Any plans to add pricing for EV charging? I bought the app (and then paid again for EV mode) only to find no pricing for charging stations.
2025-02-23T19:08:28Z,"There should be pricing info displayed if available. You can contribute data here: [https://openchargemap.org/site](https://openchargemap.org/site) if you'd like and it should show up in the app as well. Can you let me know which station this is so I can try to debug and see if there is a fix?

I could make EV mode free if you think that's best (and you're welcome to request a refund). I can also add you to the TestFlight group which gives you access to the app for free.

Edit: I think it would be cool for people to contribute data. Perhaps I can add something in the app so users can directly contribute to opencharmap.org?"
2025-02-23T21:19:39Z,Started to use this app last week ‚Äî it‚Äôs pretty solid since Apple Maps doesn‚Äôt have this functionality.
2025-02-23T21:21:11Z,Ty ty! Lmk if there‚Äôs features you‚Äôd like to see :)
2025-02-23T21:29:07Z,Based in London and no petrol stations are showing up on the app. Tried 12 miles just in case
2025-02-23T21:37:07Z,Can you try reopening the app and double checking location permission has been given to the app? It seems like there‚Äôs a bug with first time install. I‚Äôm trying to get that fixed right now and will go out in the next release!
2025-02-23T21:38:19Z,"Ha, you‚Äôre right. I had reinstalled and that still didn‚Äôt work.

Solution is to force quit and simply reopen app."
2025-02-23T21:39:11Z,"Thank you for confirming! Yeah I gotta test and fix this bug as a few have mentioned it now. I had fixed this exact issue in the past and managed to break it again lol

2025-02-24T00:34:38Z,"Just bought it. Good job, seems like a great start. Would it be possible to show the actual Octane numbers as well? Like 87, 90, 93 for example. Maybe even a setting option to show the numbers instead of just ‚ÄúReg, Mid, Premium?‚Äù"
2025-02-24T00:38:30Z,"Thank you! For UK, Germany, it‚Äôs ‚Äúeasy‚Äù to know what Octane/RON is offered at the pumps. For US/Canada it‚Äôs tricky. I could assume regular is always 87, medium is 89 and premium is 91 but around me 89 isn‚Äôt offered at shell anymore in exchange for 93 octane (so that‚Äôs 87, 91 and 93). I‚Äôll look into this and see if I can find octane numbers for each individual station!"
2025-02-24T00:47:21Z,"That‚Äôs actually why I‚Äôm asking haha. The octane numbers don‚Äôt necessarily correspond with the label here in the US! It‚Äôs annoying for sure. I always use 93 Octane for my car, but not all gas stations ‚ÄúPremium‚Äù is actually 93. Some places it‚Äôs 91, 90, etc."
2025-02-24T00:54:50Z,"Hmm, I‚Äôll do some research to see if this data is documented somewhere. As this project furthers, I‚Äôm thinking it‚Äôs best if users add data about gas stations. Openchargemaps.org is awesome as its community led to add info about charging stations. I may have to make something similar."
2025-02-24T02:47:34Z,Thanks! Good luck with the continued development of the app!
2025-02-24T02:50:12Z,Thank you!!
2025-02-23T17:33:18Z,Where do the gas prices come from?
2025-02-23T17:38:36Z,"It depends on the region. Some countries seem to be strict and require companies to report prices to the gov (UK is lovely for this) while for example in the US/Canada, GasBuddy is the most reliable. I‚Äôd like to expand the sources over time to make it more robust and perhaps even add a feature where users can crowdsource data and share back to other sources. I‚Äôm not collecting any data right now so I‚Äôd have to think about how I‚Äôd go about data harvesting and storing. My app is more or less a fancy yet ‚Äúdumb‚Äù browser showing stuff anyone can access"
2025-02-23T18:33:00Z,I'd like to try this out!
2025-02-23T18:42:52Z,Let me know what you think!  Send me an email if you want to TestFlight.

2025-02-23T20:25:31Z,"Ooh! Yes, that'd be awesome!! Let me know if you'd like to join the TestFlight! There's a link to a discord server in the app if you wanna chat there as well :)"
2025-02-23T21:55:23Z,"Oft, super excited for Australia to come. 

This is brilliant."
2025-02-23T22:09:54Z,This seems like such a great concept! Can I get a TestFlight link to try out beta features?
2025-02-23T22:53:18Z,I‚Äôd love to try this out!
2025-02-23T23:04:11Z,"TestFlight link please üòÄüëç
Glad there‚Äôs tipping options!"
2025-02-23T23:48:35Z,Doesn‚Äôt Apple Maps already do this?
2025-02-23T23:59:54Z,"Maybe it does in some regions but for the most part it doesn‚Äôt. If you have a screenshot, that‚Äôd be cool!

Waze and google maps sometimes show prices but it‚Äôs usually very outdated (at least that‚Äôs the case near me)"
2025-02-24T00:10:54Z,Very cool idea. Looking forward to trying it out.
2025-02-24T00:28:24Z,Thank you! Let me know what you think!
2025-02-24T00:22:13Z,I like it! Thank you!
2025-02-24T00:28:41Z,Thank you!! Let me know what you think!
2025-02-24T00:30:05Z,Wasn‚Äôt it free last week now it‚Äôs .99?
2025-02-24T00:34:12Z,It was! I was hoping some people would hit the ‚Äúsupport me‚Äù buttons but only a total of 3 people hit it (over 1500 installs) and that unfortunately means I‚Äôm running at a loss. I introduced a ‚Äúpro‚Äù mode to unlock EV charging stations at $4.99 but I‚Äôve made that 0.99 and the app itself 0.99. Imo $1 is pretty fair but I‚Äôd be open to other suggestions. I‚Äôm probably gonna play around with the pricing over time. It‚Äôs a one time payment with no ads or data collection.
2025-02-24T00:33:29Z,"In Canada, will it show price in cents / litre?"
2025-02-24T00:36:15Z,"Yep! I‚Äôm Canadian and Canada was the first supported region! Here‚Äôs a screenshot from a couple days ago:

2025-02-24T00:38:46Z,Haha Ty!
2025-02-24T01:01:45Z,"Just grabbed it, very nice app! Would a historical pricing feature be something you‚Äôd be able to implement?"
2025-02-24T01:03:28Z,"Thank you! That was a feature I had implemented before but it got very complex and messy having a local database so in the name of simplicity, I got rid of it. I‚Äôll have to look into that in the future. Would you want a history of all stations in the app or just a few favourite ones?"
2025-02-24T01:05:29Z,"A few favourite ones would be handy! Not a deal breaker, especially if it‚Äôs hard to implement (totally get it). 

Great work though, I hope the app is a success for you."
2025-02-24T01:10:44Z,"Thank you!

I got a couple asks for a widget to monitor a favourite station so I could maybe add some sort of alerting system for a couple stations that a user favourites."

2025-02-24T01:24:28Z,How long does it take to load fuel stations? It's been spinning for a few minutes now. I'm in WA.
2025-02-24T01:27:05Z,"Try relaunching the app and if that doesn‚Äôt fix it, double check your location permissions given to the app. This is likely the same bug that was reported earlier which I‚Äôve now fixed (and may be able to push to App Store tomorrow).

It should take maybe 10-15s to show some gas stations."
2025-02-24T01:29:40Z,"Loaded, thank you. I also selected some brand filters. By default, everything was unchecked. I think enabling brands helped."
2025-02-24T01:32:18Z,"Awesome! Definitely a few bugs to find and squish haha. 

Did you have to relaunch the app or did selecting brand filters do the trick by itself?"
2025-02-24T01:34:33Z,I did not wait long enough to figure this out. I selected brands and relaunched the app without waiting too long.
2025-02-24T01:35:52Z,Haha ok. I think the bug has been squashed anyway now but I‚Äôll poke around!
2025-02-24T05:37:24Z,When it has data for Australia I‚Äôll grab it
2025-02-24T05:42:16Z,Sounds good! Would you be interested in joining the TestFlight?

2025-02-24T16:53:38Z,"Suggestion for OP: How about a filter for Top Tier gas stations?¬†

My preference is to go to those gas stations and I always have to cross reference gas station against this website.¬†https://stationfinder.toptiergas.com/

Would love if your app had a filter for that.¬†"
2025-02-24T16:55:02Z,"Already implemented üòâ

Edit: now realizing the Top Tier badge is missing lol. The filter does work though! Let me know if a brand is missing!"
2025-02-24T09:24:48Z,Seems very limited on the stations shown and search doesn‚Äôt work for Costco. Are these features still coming?
2025-02-24T11:31:04Z,"Hmm that‚Äôs odd. Someone‚Äôs prices are omitted if they‚Äôre very old. If you can send me an email or message with a location/coordinate near you, I can take a look! If the Costco is near you, it should show in the search as well."
2025-02-24T13:18:15Z,Yeah it‚Äôs about a 10 min drive away. I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm seeing about 1/2 maybe of the gas stations I probably should be. I‚Äôll try again then can send an email.
2025-02-24T17:14:32Z,"I‚Äôve had this thought for a while and looking at your app and CarPlay I want to ask. With CarPlay and the cluster screen that has multiple apps (maps, direction, music and sometimes the fourth tile is a calendar event) could you take that calendar tile and instead show nearest gas stations and prices update within every 5 miles or so?"
2025-02-24T17:20:08Z,I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs something I can feed info into but I‚Äôll definitely take a look! I think that would be pretty neat.

2025-02-23T19:18:20Z,I did but it was taken down by mods quickly as I didn't talk much in r/apple. Couple thousand upvotes and over 6M views on the last post later...im back hahaha
2025-02-23T12:20:23Z,Finally! Hopefully Roborock brings this to older models instead of just adding to new ones
2025-02-23T12:33:13Z,I have a 2021 Roborock too. Here‚Äôs hoping.
2025-02-23T12:51:42Z,I have a 2024 S8 MaxV Ultra.  I hope that‚Äôs at least new enough.
2025-02-23T20:15:41Z,"&gt;brings this to older models 

My experience with tech is they do it for new models moving forward to encourage you to replace your ‚Äúaging‚Äù (perfectly working) ones.

My mother‚Äôs robot vacuum‚Äôs app stopped getting software updates and she can‚Äôt use the app at all anymore. It‚Äôs insane."
2025-02-23T21:23:19Z,Yeah unfortunately seems to be commonplace. Hopefully we‚Äôll be surprised
2025-02-23T19:49:58Z,I hope there will be some HomeBridge plugins to bring support for existing old devices.
2025-02-23T19:20:52Z,Are they going to do anything about how ridiculously slow matter devices take to respond and update status in home app?
2025-02-24T16:24:20Z,Mine are all super fast. Usually these issues are bad networking.
2025-02-24T21:45:58Z,"Are these lightbulbs and such? Do you ever use the physical on/off switch for them? I had a lot of issues with my Nanoleaf bulbs where if I was using the physical switches for them a lot, when the physical switch was on they'd have a lot of problems responding. 

I still use the physical switches but it seemed to get better when I tried using them less often.

I also changed my WiFi channels for 2.4 and 5GHz around to ones that are supposedly better, so hard to say which helped more."

Jony‚Äôs creative vision is behind some of the company‚Äôs seminal products which have transformed the way we live today including phones, music players and watches.  

&gt; He was born in Chingford in east London and loved drawing and spending time in his father‚Äôs workshop where the two of them made the young Jony‚Äôs Christmas presents including a go-kart, a treehouse and a toboggan.  

&gt; He studied Industrial Design at Newcastle Polytechnic and moved to San Francisco to work for Apple in 1992. In 1997 Steve Jobs returned to the company, having been ousted several years earlier, and the two of them set about revolutionising the landscape for home computers with the creation of the iMac.

2025-02-23T22:39:18Z,lol at the U2. Bet he was a nodding head at getting that album onto our iPods.
2025-02-23T22:50:48Z,I wondered if it was all his fault ;)!
2025-02-23T17:51:21Z,"if anyone is interested, jony also shared some of his music taste some months ago on [this podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/life-in-seven-songs/id1749122105?i=1000660881751) (Life in Seven Songs)"
2025-02-23T19:43:25Z,We think you‚Äôre going to love it
2025-02-23T20:30:14Z,Couldn‚Äôt care less
2025-02-24T12:15:46Z,You cared enough to vomit your comment here.
2025-02-24T15:37:11Z,OoOh you got me!
2025-02-22T19:22:23Z,"This movie starts strong but finishes weak. I would have given it 8/10 if the second half had been as good as the first half, but it gets a 6.5/10 instead."
2025-02-22T19:41:07Z,"This is absolutely spot on.  The burgeoning relationship between the two leads was cute, heartwarming and engaging and really felt like it was going somewhere interesting.  And then it just fell flat after the half way point."
2025-02-22T22:08:01Z,"Really, I enjoyed the second half more then the first.  I could the whole inside the gorge hollow man hellhole interesting.  Guess I‚Äôm the only one."
2025-02-22T22:48:29Z,I thought the second half rounded out the first. Big build up and some fun action set pieces.
2025-02-23T00:33:53Z,"It was basically a video game. The action sequences were competently executed, but they looked right out of one of the modern Tomb Raider games. As soon as we could see what was inside the gorge, all mystique was gone."
2025-02-23T03:26:52Z,I agree but that part actually made me like it more. I wish it fully commited to it instead. It honestly felt like it could‚Äôve been a resident evil movie if they wanted.
2025-02-23T03:52:57Z,"For me, it‚Äôs could have been one more level in left for dead series.  Just needed 2 more characters, especially one that‚Äôs very sarcastic!"
2025-02-23T14:45:56Z,"I think the second half should have reined in on explaining everything a bit too much. I enjoyed the mystery of ""what the fuck is going on down there? That's creepy and weird"" but then they just went ahead and explained the whole thing.


I feel like they could have veered a bit closer to [Annihilation](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2798920/) which also sets up a bunch of mysterious shit but keeps the weird mystique vibe going, even though we know most of the mystery."
2025-02-23T07:14:11Z,"I thought both halves were interesting but didn‚Äôt fit.

Either do a forbidden love story without the monsters, where they‚Äôre on a seemingly pointless mission to guard a random hole the ground. The guy still falls in, the girl rescues him simply because he fell in a giant pit, not because of monsters. They find evidence in the pit of shady dealings and the mercs try to kill them. Basically the same as the actual movie. The monsters don‚Äôt really add anything. 

*Or* make a monster movie, drop most of the romance stuff, and go further with some of the monster plot lines. Like they had a bit establishing the monsters were smart and could set traps, but then they never used that again. I‚Äôd have liked to see them have to outsmart the monsters at some point."
2025-02-22T19:26:00Z,"I‚Äôd agree, it was still fun but the first half was definitely the better part of the story."
2025-02-22T20:01:04Z,"Not sure it even starts strong. A strange love story across a valley seemed a tad ridiculous. üòÇ

That said, I feel like the worst part of this movie was actually the trailer. One of them implied this was about a portal to hell - I was totally relieved when I found out that was not actually the movie."
2025-02-22T20:36:25Z,Right? An actual portal to hell would have been better than (yet another) virus threat.
2025-02-23T00:02:06Z,"I liked that the trailer didn't give it away, but yeah, I'd have prefer if the gorge was demonic, instead of man-made terror.  Good movie overall though."
2025-02-23T05:30:57Z,Through and though fucking bad. And kinda a rip off of the podcast Tower 4.
2025-02-23T07:34:50Z,"It was laughly bad.¬†

Interesting premise, that they manage to make incredibly tedious. Lots of potential for interesting elements, but just when you think it might be about to get interesting, they somehow manage to make it even duller.¬†

3/10"
2025-02-23T02:02:22Z,"Agreed. In fact, I'd like to argue that it would have been better as a series. It just felt too rushed as a movie."
2025-02-23T05:58:37Z,Ha! You me same same!
2025-02-22T21:03:06Z,"It didn‚Äôt start strong IMO. They failed to create any audience connection with the characters nor a believable one between them.

The first 45 mins of this movie barely managed a fraction of the emotional connection that UP achieved in 4 mins.

Even just the believability of the character motivations was a fail. They should have set Miles‚Äôs character up as being at rock bottom but hiding it from the client. As having a career of rigidly following the rules but internally he‚Äôs almost cracking. Then it would make sense that he‚Äôd so willingly break one of the golden rules right at the start of the mission. 

I could sum this movie up as: all plot and no feeling."
2025-02-22T20:19:01Z,Can't understand the title
2025-02-22T22:07:44Z,"""The Gorge"", which stars Miles Teller and Anya Taylor-Joy, becomes Apple's biggest movie launch.

It's a terribly written title."
2025-02-22T23:06:13Z,"Agreed-the-title-is
-awful"
2025-02-23T00:35:45Z,Title terrible writer Anya Teller Joy Taylor Starrer staring title becomes movie tellers terrible title.
2025-02-23T05:55:39Z,/r/Titlegore
2025-02-22T22:04:02Z,"I think they mean that the excessive hyphenating of Teller-Anya and Joy-Starrer looks weird.

When I first read it, I wondered if she got married to someone named ""Starrer""? (making her *Anya Taylor-Joy-Starrer*).

^(Edit: Oops, I think I replied this to the wrong person...)"
2025-02-22T23:51:24Z,Best part is they left ‚ÄòTaylor Joy‚Äô unhyphenated
2025-02-23T01:21:25Z,"Thank you, I forgot that part in my comment!

So, not only did they add confusing hyphens, but they also took out a hyphen."
2025-02-23T02:32:45Z,Felt like I was having a stroke.
2025-02-23T05:58:51Z,Apple's Mile's-Teller's and Ana-Taylor's-Joy's starrer's 'The Gorge' become's the streamer's biggest-movie-launch.. what's not's to get's?
2025-02-23T07:31:16Z,That's the Deadline method.
2025-02-22T19:35:36Z,"We enjoyed it just fine. Weird shifts in momentum at times, but likable enough characters and some nice camera work. Wish they held some of the nature porn shots longer in the beginning. Why capture beautiful scenery and then cut literally 1.5 seconds later?"
2025-02-22T23:58:42Z,Just seemed low stakes in the gorge because clearly nothing was going to happen to them
2025-02-22T23:02:52Z,It was so stupid. I Loved it.
2025-02-22T19:36:00Z,The plot holes in this movie are big enough to fit a jumbo jet.
2025-02-22T20:53:05Z,I love how they time skipped over the part how they scaled the top of the wall when they had dozens of mines and guns at the top specifically setup to stop someone from scaling the top of the wall. ¬†
2025-02-22T21:12:39Z,"The part when they were in the gorge, Levi mentions that they can think tactically. I imagined that means the creatures formulated a plan to get around the sensors."
2025-02-22T22:12:05Z,The idea that there were cables on the floor leads me to believe they built safety pathways up.
2025-02-23T01:03:50Z,I think it was the end of the cable Levi was climbing across the gorge with. It was still anchored to that tree on Drasa‚Äôs side.
2025-02-22T23:39:28Z,Did they ever explain why there were modern computers in the gorge?
2025-02-23T00:38:05Z,"Yes, they were put there by the company that employs the main characters, and which goes into the gorge to collect samples for their genetic research. At some point they switched to the futuristic drones."
2025-02-23T00:29:47Z,I‚Äôve read the title 7 times and I still don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs trying to say.
2025-02-23T04:23:44Z,It's pretty awful if you don't know the names of the actors. Also first time ever seeing the word starrer which in this case reads like the second part of a double-barrelled surname.
2025-02-22T22:12:30Z,What a fun movie
2025-02-22T19:43:52Z,Not surprised. It is an absolute hoot from beginning to end.
2025-02-22T20:32:08Z,"They went in a familiar direction at the end and I think that was the wrong move. I think more ridiculous would‚Äôve been better.

Interesting plot. Good start. Corny romancing. Falls off pretty quick at the end."
2025-02-23T12:52:14Z,Hey I loved it. People love to hate everything these days but I had a good time
2025-02-22T21:22:50Z,Pretty cool movie to be honest
2025-02-22T22:00:05Z,I enjoyed it!
2025-02-22T20:13:47Z,"It was odd and I quite enjoyed it, watched it twice so far"
2025-02-23T00:42:31Z,Whoever wrote this title should be prosecuted for indecency to the English language
2025-02-23T02:23:15Z,It was much better than i expected
2025-02-23T16:41:07Z,It‚Äôs because it‚Äôs a new movie that aired between Severance episodes and folks are seeing what else there is to watch.
2025-02-22T20:42:24Z,This headline makes me so angry.
2025-02-22T23:14:40Z,Reddits quickboop - fragrant-hamster poster ‚Äòr/apple‚Äô Becomes Redditor‚Äôs Biggest Angry Post Headline.
2025-02-22T23:46:25Z,"I saw someone call it Annihilation meets romantic comedy, which I think is pretty accurate. But unfortunately the result lands in an awkward uncanny gorge between the two.

It felt like it was trying to be too many things and didn't execute any of them particularly well. Very cookie cutter plot. I found myself skipping through some scenes, e.g. the nods to Whiplash and Queens Gambit, which I guess are cute, but I was hoping for more a hard/intellectual scifi movie, like Arrival."
2025-02-22T19:26:38Z,"I‚Äôm going to be very careful here. I love what Apple has done with Ted Lasso, Severance, Mythic Quest, Acapulco. I can go on. These are two incredible actors and the budget for this film was right. But OMG I could not get over the monsters. I just saw cartoonish ghouls that all should be saying I‚Äôm groot. I don‚Äôt know how you can ruin a movie like this with the CGI but for me at least it was the biggest disappointment. They could‚Äôve done something really awesome. Instead they not only wasted the main characters, they even undersold Sigourney Weaver! How the f do you drop the ball like that"
2025-02-23T00:40:35Z,"I don't think it was a problem of CGI quality, it was just that they were very generic monsters. The idea of the valley being full of human-nature hybrids could have been interesting, but the only thing they did with it was the flesh-eating tree, the rest were basically zombies."
2025-02-23T01:34:34Z,I agree. I feel like the whole point of the movie was that mystery and that just landed flat on me
2025-02-23T00:08:47Z,"I liked the movie. It was good. The part that I really liked was the way they both connected from far and communicating without words. 

After that it became pretty generic, had the second part been as good it would have been a classic but still entertaining enough."
2025-02-23T00:09:00Z,They could have done without the monsters
2025-02-23T00:19:46Z,Trent Reznor killed it on this soundtrack
2025-02-23T01:19:14Z,Absolutely horrific title
2025-02-23T01:27:53Z,Just ridiculous WTF does it mean üòÇ
2025-02-23T16:00:14Z,Gorge is another word for a canyon.
2025-02-23T02:02:00Z,Writer needs to get a pay-cut for that headline title.
2025-02-23T02:12:43Z,I was pleasantly suprised by the movie because I knew nothing about it and went in thinking it would be some generic assassin type movie again.
2025-02-23T02:22:08Z,I couldn‚Äôt buy into their relationship at all. It was fun and flirty but it felt rushed when they got to saying I love you. I didn‚Äôt feel that level of connection between them at all
2025-02-23T04:57:44Z,Was this a Stranger Things prequel?
2025-02-23T06:43:23Z,"Just watched it, totally fine movie to throw on for a Friday night. I‚Äôd give it a 7/10. 

At this point I appreciate any movie that immediately looks interesting and easily digestible. This type of movie is easy to just press play on vs browsing endlessly."
2025-02-23T07:15:02Z,It was okay but the gorge was pretty much a red herring while the relationship was the real plot device. The things found in the gorge were silly and disappointing.
2025-02-23T07:35:42Z,"A movie about the Gorge and the monsters and how to protect shit would have been great instead of this shitty romance in front of shitty CGI paintings.

If you want to make a romance plot, then use people whose ""feelings"" don't feel faker than the woods around the gorge"
2025-02-23T08:18:42Z,Someone's full name is Miles Teller Anya Taylor Joy Starrer? That's quite the name.
2025-02-23T14:52:34Z,How? That movie was absolutely horrendous?
2025-02-23T17:09:55Z,Can't wait for The Summer of Gorge.
2025-02-23T17:40:23Z,We live in a society!
2025-02-23T17:40:02Z,I enjoyed it. And the monsters origins and design were great
2025-02-23T17:43:04Z,Do these editors do lines before writing headlines?
2025-02-22T19:23:07Z,"&gt;Apple Original Films‚Äô The Gorge has become the biggest film launch in the young streamer‚Äôs history. The Gorge eclipses numbers turned in by the Jon Watts-directed George Clooney-Brad Pitt-starrer Wolfs, which launched last fall, pivoting from a planned wide release to a small theatrical and global streaming release.

&gt;Apple does not divulge specific numbers, but the company confirms it is the biggest film premiere in Apple TV+ history, driving double-digit growth globally for the service and boosting new viewers by +80%, weekend over weekend, following its debut on Friday, February 14. This comes after Deadline revealed that Severance eclipsed Ted Lasso to become Apple TV+‚Äôs most viewed series in the history of the service.

&gt;‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a thrill for all of us at Apple to see the unforgettably original and inventive world Scott has created with ‚ÄòThe Gorge‚Äô resonate in such a massive way with audiences around the globe,‚Äù said Matt Dentler, head of features, Apple Original Films."
2025-02-22T22:56:34Z,The movie had a good start but disappointing at the end. Felt a little rushed. They could have considered having a sequel rather than how it ended. Still enjoyed the whole show though.
2025-02-23T00:54:33Z,It was OK but I hope this isn't the film Anya chose to do over Nosferatu.
2025-02-23T01:46:01Z,Decent movie. Both are good actors with good chemistry. The kind of goofy premise with tons of plot holes prevent it from being great.
2025-02-23T02:58:10Z,The premise just didn't interest me.
2025-02-23T05:58:22Z,I'll get crucified for this but this film would've been 1000000x better if there were no action component. Just leave it creepy and develop the love story between the two characters.
2025-02-24T03:15:31Z,That would have been an interesting way to run it. Not sure how much story there would be though. How many times can they zip back and forth to see each other before it gets boring?
2025-02-23T06:48:57Z,"The very end scene was so pointless, it explained nothing about how they got out of there. 

Other than that, I did enjoy the rest of the movie. All of it was unexpected. I originally thought it was one giant creature in the gorge"
2025-02-23T13:50:31Z,make decent movies get decent reviews and high numbers of viewers. If they had sticked the landing with the second half this movie would have gotten an 8/10 from me.
2025-02-23T19:41:49Z,How high is the bar to be Apple‚Äôs highest movie launch?
2025-02-24T02:03:29Z,I stopped watching after they started playing drums üòÜ
2025-02-24T02:28:10Z,"Apple TV+ has only really gotten me to watch 2 shows all the way through so far. 

Personally I feel like they‚Äôve been missing really hard on this service. I‚Äôm not sure why, but none of these have interested me or they seemed interesting until I started it and got bored."
2025-02-24T03:16:35Z,Our house has been the exact opposite. I feel the quality of the Apple TV + shows is miles ahead of other streaming networks.
2025-02-24T03:11:51Z,It was a fun movie. We definitely enjoyed it. I‚Äôve been recommending it to everyone to check out.
2025-02-24T03:32:49Z,I rather liked it.  Me and my wife watched it and enjoyed it.  I will say it actually did feel like it wills make an awesome video game plot.  For like a co-op style game.  But it was fun.  Not going to say it‚Äôs my favorite movie ever but I enjoyed my time with it.  I think of the Apple Original movies I still rank Tetris near my top
2025-02-24T17:09:18Z,"Loved it. Great premise. 8/10. Although, I give anything these days a 5/10 minimum if it's not a sequel, remake, prequel, or requel. 

Sigourney Weaver's character was disappointing, very sloppy dialogue. It's not entirely her fault, just bad lines for her character. Miles Teller's character also had some over-exposition in the beginning. There are some plot holes. I feel like the British Royal Marine character completely and laughably **undersold** the danger of The Gorge.

Anya is a gem. She elevates anything that she's in. Her and Miles had good chemistry. Scott Derrickson is a master of eerie and haunting environments, and The Gorge is 100% his signature. Loved the atmosphere of the movie. Loved the suspense. Anya and Miles were tacti-cool together. Solid payoff."
2025-02-22T20:21:54Z,Blows me away. Just a bad movie all around‚Ä¶.
2025-02-23T21:25:13Z,Oh nice! Does it have a widget option??
2025-02-23T18:49:45Z,Would be awesome if you could develop some watch os compatibility too. Downloading as we speak though

2025-02-22T19:04:30Z,"I think the bigger issue isn‚Äôt the price, it‚Äôs the abysmal lack of content to make the most of those 4k. Frankly we all know spatial computing isn‚Äôt really that needed, it‚Äôs experiences that we need, and they‚Äôre just not there. And btw it‚Äôs partly due to current tech limitations as well, because streaming super high quality content requires lots of bandwidth and/or storage."
2025-02-22T19:29:05Z,Yeah every few months I see a new feature or video and want to buy one. But then I see a large portion of people say they only use it once or twice a month because there isn‚Äôt really that much to do on it. It seems like the main use case is the Mac virtual display which is really cool but now I need to also buy a Mac since I mainly just use my iPad. At this point I think I‚Äôll just wait it out and see what the second generation has to offer.
2025-02-22T19:54:36Z,"If you mainly use your iPad then I don‚Äôt see why you‚Äôd need a Mac for Virtual Display.¬†

Vision Pro supports iPad apps so technically you can multi task with iPad apps + native apps.

With that said, I agree. Apart from the occasional 5 minute Apple immersive video that gets released once in a blue moon, I only use it for Virtual Display. Though for me as a software developer who relies on 3 monitors, PERSONALLY, that‚Äôs worth the price. It means I‚Äôm not tethered to my home office and I can somewhat comfortably work from anywhere.¬†

I just wish there was more 3D / immersive content or at least some serious immersive games (like Zelda but immersive and 3D) which I could play when I‚Äôm not working. It doesn‚Äôt need to have PS5 graphics, Switch graphics is fine as long as the game has depth and a good storyline. Regular controller is also fine, I‚Äôm not even asking for the PSVR split controllers."
2025-02-22T19:58:31Z,"Isn‚Äôt the issue though a lot of iPad apps (like YouTube and Netflix) did not enable the build target for Vision Pro? Although it seems like for those apps you can just use safari and get basically the same experience as the iPad app.

Do you use ALVR or anything like that to stream VR games?

I‚Äôve also thought about just finding a used one on eBay"
2025-02-22T22:11:15Z,"iPad apps are opt out , not opt in.  So most just work.  The issue with YouTube and Netflix is that Google and Netflix explicitly disabled Vision Pro support.   Netflix has abandoned their  Meta quest app, so that is by design."
2025-02-22T20:55:13Z,"So, how is it for coding?

I'm currently doing a large extension on my home, which somehow means I am now without a desk or study.  So I am seriously considering buying a vision Pro simply to get back some screen real estate that I've lost since switching to a laptop."
2025-02-22T22:41:39Z,"It‚Äôs great!

Though I strongly recommend getting a head strap like this for long sessions, the two straps included with the VP are shit

https://www.globular-cluster.com/CMA1.html"
2025-02-22T19:30:41Z,"No the big issue is certainly the price. Mfs are struggling out here we don‚Äôt have $4000 to spend on some apple vision headset. I don‚Äôt do office work nor do I care if everything isn‚Äôt 4k, if it wasn‚Äôt going to cost me a few paychecks I‚Äôd own one. Capitalistic corporate greed is becoming delusion. How tf does anyone at Apple think the average consumer is going to spend this much money on something that isn‚Äôt even practical?"
2025-02-22T19:54:26Z,I don‚Äôt think they intended for this first model to be for the average consumer. I‚Äôd look at this as a beta/dev kit to get the app development and bugs worked out before hitting the big stage with a lower priced consumer model.
2025-02-22T20:08:00Z,"They clearly weren‚Äôt trying to make a product for the average consumer on the first iteration. It‚Äôs called the Vision Pro after all.

Every other product category they sell has an average consumer model.¬†

iPhone Pro / iPhone¬†
iPad Pro / iPad¬†
AirPods Pro / AirPods
MacBook Pro / MacBook Air
Watch Ultra / Watch
Etc

A cheaper model will be introduced at some point and it‚Äôll probably be named Apple Vision.¬†

It‚Äôs not uncommon for companies to release a premium model first.

I actually think it makes a lot of sense. People who can afford to purchase a first gen device and who are ‚ÄúPros‚Äù (whatever that means to you, for me I‚Äôm a software developer/photographer/web designer) are much more likely to excuse the lack of entertainment made for the platform because they‚Äôre using it for work.

Casual users would instantly complain because they expect it to be a Meta Quest with its large library of games."
2025-02-22T20:56:02Z,"&gt; They clearly weren‚Äôt trying to make a product for the average consumer on the first iteration.  

The main issue is they made a product for no one."
2025-02-22T22:47:30Z,"I obviously don‚Äôt have insider knowledge but I thought they basically hit their sales target? They made a certain amount and they sold a certain amount.¬†

People purchased it, early adopters.¬†

They made the product for early adopters, tech enthusiasts, pros who have a specific use case, and people with lots of money to waste on toys.

I was actually paid by Apple to provide a LOT of feedback for about 6 months straight. I had to do weekly check ins, share how I was using it, share any pain points, share what I thought was missing, etc. So in a way they released a product to get real world feedback to improve their second gen and their cheaper model."
2025-02-23T06:40:55Z,They kept cutting back production. They then spun the early adopter line to account for the terrible sales.
2025-02-23T02:55:03Z,The MacBook Pro did indeed come out before the MacBook.
2025-02-23T06:41:58Z,"I hate to use Tesla as an example because I‚Äôm not sure I like the company anymore, but Tesla has the same strategy with their models early on. They sold the expensive sexy ones early on and moved less volume, but used the income from it to roll it into future products that were cheaper and more mainstream. That seems to be what Apple is doing herethe main stream Apple vision will come"
2025-02-22T19:52:11Z,The video was insanely cool but the rest was okay. I think it‚Äôs less impressive if you‚Äôve used VR before
2025-02-22T23:21:24Z,"Did a demo while owning a Quest 3

I was most impressed by the eye tracking and gesture controls."
2025-02-22T19:09:33Z,"It also doesn‚Äôt help that it‚Äôs a first gen product. Even as someone who wastes way too much money on dumb niche tech, I almost always wait for a gen 2 version that irons out the annoyances no one thought of until the product was actually in people‚Äôs hands."
2025-02-22T21:23:05Z,"Honestly, I think this was by design. To me, it always seemed like a high-end prototype for tech enthusiasts to test drive; I have a feeling a ~$2,000-2,500 Apple Vision product will drop in the next couple years."
2025-02-22T18:47:34Z,"This is the best way to put it. I did the Demo and raved about it to everyone who would listen, but followed up with ‚Äúif it was half its price I would maybe consider it‚Äù."
2025-02-22T19:18:58Z,"Yup. Amazing demo, spatial video is legit a brand new jaw dropper thing, and when it costs a grand and weighs half what it does now, so say in eight years, I‚Äôll totally buy one. Or I‚Äôll buy the big heavy uncomfortable gen one version second hand in about five years for a grand and change. I‚Äôd want it for stage performances as well. To be able to go to a totally sold out incredible broadway play. Pay thirty bucks put on headphones and have the best seat in the house. Yes please. Sports too. If the category flourishes, sports will be nuts on it."
2025-02-22T20:53:54Z,"It's not _just_ the price.

They made it heavy because it has to feel _premium_ instead of prioritizing comfort and lightness (same issue with the AirPods Max), they added features that add costs and weight and make the battery life worse (the creepy EyeSight) that for a significant portion of people do not matter at all. Also the FOV is not great either.

And it doesn't suit the two bigger VR drivers right now: games and porn. While it's not great at ""productivity"" either.

Great device, but has a ways to go.

If it had the same price, but was super comfortable and light, with a longer battery life, and had proper gaming and productivity functions, it would have done better than it did."
2025-02-23T08:24:37Z,The odd thing is all this can be applied to the 1995 Virtual Boy. So the lessons learned from 30 years ago were forgotten.
2025-02-22T18:48:52Z,It was just simply too expensive to gain mass adoption.
2025-02-22T22:45:24Z,"
I think we have too many distractions in this day and age.  Many computers and gadgets were far more expensive than $3500 in the 80s and 90s in real terms.  The C64 was $1900 USD in current dollars when it was first released!"
2025-02-22T18:36:06Z,"They priced it at a point where nobody in their right mind or with economic sense would touch it. 

No audience = no apps = dead product"
2025-02-22T18:47:58Z,"The price was a problem, but it wasn‚Äôt the *biggest* problem.

People would have paid that price *if it did something they needed*. But it doesn‚Äôt. Outside of a handful of industrial uses, augmented reality has consistently bombed when put into consumer hands. We don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs for. We don‚Äôt have a great use for it. It isn‚Äôt even entertaining most of the time.

If you‚Äôre going to introduce a $3500 device, it needs to have a use case that will spur mass adoption. It needs a killer app. And AVP did not have a killer application."
2025-02-22T22:40:40Z,"I genuinely think the only thing I ‚Äúown‚Äù that costs as much or more than the Vision Pro is my car. And I had to finance that. Even my MacBook Pro was half of that, and I only spent as much as I did because I wanted a better computer for work. Literally nothing else in my house even comes close."
2025-02-23T03:17:05Z,"&gt; Outside of a handful of industrial uses, augmented reality has consistently bombed when put into consumer hands. We don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs for. We don‚Äôt have a great use for it. It isn‚Äôt even entertaining most of the time.

Yep, there just isn't anything super compelling that they bring to the table once you get past the initial ""wow"" factor.  

Worse, *it is consistently more annoying to use than other pieces of technology.*

VR headsets may take time for some people to acclimate to in terms of motion sickness, force you to stare at screens at all times, have garbage battery life, block your awareness of the outside world and make you feel isolated unless pass through is on(and still make you seem checked out to others regardless), make you look dorky, mess with your hair and makeup, and are just generally less significantly comfortable for long periods of use(yes, even 'lightweight' ones. People just plain hate putting things on their face...ask the folks who refuse to wear glasses and resort to sticking things in their eyes to see).

There isn't a single activity for the average consumer which isn't actively compromised or unnecessarily complicated by them.

AR Glasses *may* end up being the way this technology finally breaks through, but honestly while I was bullish on them a year ago....as more of the early versions of this tech hit the market(and completely fail to capture an audience outside tech nerds) I increasingly suspect even that could be a hard sell."
2025-02-22T22:46:15Z,"&gt; We don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs for

Other than the industry specific stuff you mention - gaming. Not all games are good on it, but there‚Äôs a core niche of games that do really well on it. Apple hates games tho."
2025-02-22T23:39:23Z,"Chicken and Egg problem. Devs need a device too, you know, develop on.

Version 1 allows them to start playing and any early adopter bleeding edgers can play too.

Apple products aren‚Äôt ready for the masses until V3, same as it has always been."
2025-02-22T18:41:08Z,During a looming recession and on the heels of a world wide pandemic. Smrt.
2025-02-22T19:30:45Z,If they had released it in 2019 or early 2020 I bet it would‚Äôve really gained traction since people had nothing else to do.
2025-02-22T22:18:17Z,This is in reality the entire reason the Meta quest has a user base of 20 million.  It was a onetime aberration and all sales have been collapsing ever since.
2025-02-22T21:12:56Z,And a lot of extra money too.
2025-02-22T19:03:44Z,"Yeah, it really felt like a ""read the room"" moment."
2025-02-23T00:00:20Z,"People do not understand Silicon Valley. Amazon wasn‚Äôt seeing success until the 2008 recession and they were burning through money. Now they own the market nad have basically choked everyone out due to warehousing reach. Nobody can deliver faster worldwide.

I look at the Touchbar, Vision Pro, AppleTV, Smart Home as a play for the living room that will be between Apple, Microsoft and Meta. Microsoft isn‚Äôt trying to sell consoles anymore and gaming is likely to evolve soon.

Having fabricated hardware myself, I see the Vision Pro V1 as a test of viability and a way to press the market forward. We are already seeing lighter solutions and Meta is attacking it from a different angle in which theg will likely merge Raybans and their VR headset at a later date when they look more like glasses.

Don‚Äôt forget  FAANG have money to burn as this is mainly a 20 year R&amp;D phase."
2025-02-22T20:39:31Z,"It was the definition of a first generation product. Too expensive, not enough functionality, niche market."
2025-02-22T18:45:24Z,"The average person has no use for a $3500 augmented reality headset that does not play video games.

If AVP had also launched with a bevy of AR or VR games that people wanted to play *and* were platform exclusive, I think the device might have been more successful in finding an audience. But without video games, AVP is kinda useless to most of us. And we‚Äôre not going to pay $3500 for what amounts to a toy.

Apple *needs* to start taking video games seriously. It‚Äôs the thing that‚Äôs actually holding them back in terms of Mac sales, and it‚Äôs what ultimately doomed Vision Pro."
2025-02-22T18:49:29Z,As someone who really enjoys playing VR games the lack of games is really disappointing. They really should have stuff like superhot and beat saber a part of apple arcade for the vision pro
2025-02-22T20:26:40Z,This is the exact reason why I can‚Äôt really justify a MacBook at the moment. Apple needs some kind of answer to proton on Lennox or I just don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre ever going to be gaming machines. I mean they‚Äôre literally the richest tech company on the planet is there some reason they can invest more funds into gaming?
2025-02-22T21:07:18Z,"Proton also exists for Mac. It‚Äôs how so many games on Steam actually *do* work on Macs, especially older games that can be easily translated to Apple‚Äôs GPU API and especially on old Intel Macs.

The issue is that over on Linux, you‚Äôre using the same graphics cards that you do on Windows. As a result, a lot of the code that actually generates the UI for video games does not need to change when you change operating systems. But on a Mac, graphics are a different story, as Apple doesn‚Äôt actually support industry standard graphics APIs on macOS anymore.  (Linux *does* provide such support for M1 GPUs, so it‚Äôs not that it isn‚Äôt possible, it‚Äôs just that Apple is being deliberately difficult‚Äîlater Apple Silicon processors are still under active development, and their drivers have not landed in the mainstream Linux kernel yet.) 

That all said, there are only three categories of people for whom the lack of games should be a reason to pass on a MacBook Air (because of the inherent compromises in gaming laptops):

1. College students
2. Frequent travelers
3. Budget-sensitive gamers who can only afford one computer

The reason I say this is because if you have a desktop rig, there *are* workarounds, especially for single-player games.  You *can* connect to your desktop rig from your Mac. If you‚Äôre on the same network, you‚Äôll likely be fine to remote into your desktop rig and play that way.  But this will not work as a travel solution, as lag will get to be a real pain quickly if you are not on the same local network. And you will *always* have a better PC gaming experience in front of an actual desktop gaming rig."
2025-02-23T03:03:23Z,"They do invest into gaming, the game porting toolkit exists for that reason. Now the reason gaming is so poor on Macs is they don't want people to play games unless THEY make money from it. The toolkit exists to demonstrate and convince devs to bring their games to Apple arcade or the app store.

Being able to support steam games would be a nightmare for them because they make no money from that."
2025-02-23T03:23:49Z,"&gt; The average person has no use for a $3500 augmented reality headset that does not play video games.

The average doesn't even have a use for a $500 mixed reality headset that DOES play games.

That's the problem.  The entire VR market is, has been for decades, and will be for the foreseeable future, one primarily aimed at tech enthusiasts, gamers and other hobbyists, and niche professional use cases.  

No one outside that slice of the market wants to strap screens on their heads for hours at a time, when they have a phone/tablet/laptop instead.  Period.  *Maybe* AR glasses will take off, but honestly...I'm not even sure of that, considering how many people *literally need glasses to see properly* and still either try to avoid wearing them as much as possible or prefer sticking lenses in their eyes over it.

That's how deeply ingrained it is for people to *fucking hate having to wear something on their face.*"
2025-02-22T18:59:26Z,"I think another problem is the form factor for AR VR headsets in general.  They suck, you look like a dork, they are heavy and uncomfortable, and they are hard to use for people that wear glasses.  Nobody is going to put something in their face that doesn‚Äôt make them more attractive."
2025-02-22T19:33:17Z,"Dang, I know the 'Redditors don't read articles' meme, but this comment section really shows that nobody here has watched or even intends to watch the video and are just discussing whatever they want."
2025-02-22T19:55:38Z,That‚Äôs the Reddit experience.
2025-02-22T20:26:37Z,It's pretty sad. Quinn makes several interesting points and hot takes worth bickering about but the thread just went totally elsewhere.
2025-02-22T20:40:33Z,I love mine and use it nearly everyday via the virtual display for my Mac. It‚Äôs become so embedded in my workflow I can‚Äôt imagine going back to not having it. I understand it‚Äôs not for everyone though given the price. I hope that Apple doesn‚Äôt give up on it and releases a cheaper model so it can go mainstream
2025-02-23T06:45:16Z,"I've seen others say that Mac screen mirroring is their primary use, but it does make my wonder why Apple didn't let vision pros run Mac apps, they're literally using the same processors."
2025-02-23T19:30:07Z,"Right? Their whole thing was ‚Äú*Spatial Computing*‚Äù, but you need an *actual* computer to do any sort meaningful work on it"
2025-02-22T18:53:46Z,"Apple: Please make apps for our AR/VR device.¬†

Also Apple: No, not games. People don‚Äôt buy games.¬†

Also Apple: Only for our App Store. No sideloading. No apps where we can‚Äôt get a 30% cut. And that means no apps where is taking 30% would make it unprofitable for you.¬†

Final Apple: Why no one making software for our restricted device? Why no one buying it?"
2025-02-22T22:49:13Z,"The thing that people don‚Äôt mention is that the APIs are shit. You‚Äôre boxed into SwiftUI, which is limited and buggy. And there‚Äôs so much basic stuff you can‚Äôt do/don‚Äôt have access to."

EDIT: For anyone actually curious in how egocentric data is being used in the field of AI and robotics, [this](https://egomimic.github.io) is a recent paper from a Georgia Tech student with some cool results."
2025-02-22T20:06:06Z,‚ÄúEgocentric data collection‚Äù? The too-on-the-nose satire is even writing itself now.
2025-02-22T22:11:08Z,Care to elaborate?
2025-02-22T19:04:28Z,I disagree. The devs should have been given a dev kit a year in advance because the biggest issue with it is lack of dev support.
2025-02-22T21:33:45Z,"As a dev, I see the current device as the advance dev kit. This is a whole new platform and it is just beginning."
2025-02-22T18:58:54Z,"I saved my money to buy the AVP for when it releases here in Mexico, one year or more later there‚Äôs not a hint of when is it coming"
2025-02-23T04:02:46Z,Apple failed to embrace games properly‚Ä¶ again‚Ä¶
2025-02-22T18:37:02Z,"Super ironic watching this from my Vision. I love mine, great for so many tasks and media. New major update today too. Do I recommend anyone need to buy this? Nawh. But it will mature and cheaper models will arrive. Until then I‚Äôll keep enjoying it for what it‚Äôs worth."
2025-02-22T19:03:27Z,I had a Quest and switched to the AVP. My problem is that there isn‚Äôt much the AVP can do that the Quest can‚Äôt at a much lower price point and with more game dev support.
2025-02-22T19:21:55Z,"Yeah, SteamVR works, but it‚Äôs a little clunky to get set up. I don‚Äôt use it to game much, maybe some golf or flight sims (which is actually sick). 
  
It‚Äôs mostly a work, creative and media device for me. You definitely have to carve out your workflow at first. Once you‚Äôre used to it, staying organized and focused is probably it‚Äôs stronger perk for me"
2025-02-22T18:40:49Z,"I personally always thought it was going to be like this because it's just like the apple watch (albeit more expensive and complicated). Release the first gen, get early tech enthusiasts and some developers to get it, and then listen to their feed back about what it should, and shouldn't, focus on for the next generation. IMO with the apple watch it wasn't until the S4 that it REALLY was a good product."
2025-02-22T18:44:57Z,"Yeah I think they'll soon realize this is for media consumption and gaming, some people use it as a Mac display for work but it seems like the main thing people get out of it is movies."
2025-02-22T19:38:52Z,"It‚Äôs a product two years too early, two thousand too much, and too useless to own."
2025-02-22T18:55:30Z,It‚Äôs technology seeking a use case. Cool demo but doesn‚Äôt solve any problems.
2025-02-22T21:44:00Z,"It is wild to me how anyone can be so unimaginative. Think of all the many use cases we have for desktops, laptops, smartphones and tablets etc.
Can you really not think of _anything_ where an immersive spatial interface has _any_ use case at all?"
2025-02-22T22:32:52Z,"Yeah, with enough advancements in battery and processor tech, spatial interface will definitely reach mainstream. Maybe not in 5 years, but likely in 15. It‚Äôs an objectively better tech that utilizes a whole new dimension, leveraging more senses than just vision and hearing. If tiktok and short-form media with flashy flat-screen video and audio are highly addictive, imagine what a fully interactive 3d environment could do, where sounds come from any direction and you get tactile feedback from interactions. People will be absolutely hooked."
2025-02-22T19:09:34Z,"Side note: This guy is suggesting Apple has sold 400,000 of these things. 

1. That seems like a lot. 
2. If true, that means 1.4 BILLION dollars worth of revenue for apple. Not sure what their R and D and costs have been but that is wild for a product everyone wants to say failed."
2025-02-22T22:25:14Z,"Somewhere between 400,000 and 500,000 is accurate.  All the doom and gloom is mostly click bait.  I‚Äôd expect they would break even on it this year, but it‚Äôll take another generation or two to recoup historical R&amp;D costs."
2025-02-22T18:37:53Z,I know it has flaws and there are cheaper options.  But I still really want a Vision Pro.  The price is the only thing keeping me from owning one.
2025-02-22T19:39:54Z,"I don‚Äôt think it was really intended to be a broad consumer product. It was a novelty, a luxury item, and a proof of concept of how Apple would operate in this AR/VR space.¬†"
2025-02-23T01:32:48Z,It‚Äôs still a spatial iPad.
2025-02-23T02:51:35Z,"It's too expensive and it's a first-gen product. It was only ever meant to appeal to early adopters with a lot of money.

Just like no one beyond diehards used macOS 10 until Jaguar or so. Cheetah and Puma were just too buggy and slow, but they were great previews of where the OS was going."
2025-02-24T04:02:48Z,"The Meta Quest headset does *not* sell in volume and it's sold at the $300 to $500 price range.

There's no way a headset that's 10 times more expensive is going to sell in volume.

That's not even discussing the ergonomics (too heavy to wear for long periods of time) and aesthetics (looks dorky).

It's not, and will not be a product with mass appeal any time soon."
2025-02-22T18:46:33Z,"Besides price, the device is also horrible for families in that it cannot be shared by others in the household due to the specific way it fits each person. Unlike an iPad that anyone can pickup and use.

And the answer isn‚Äôt ‚Äújust buy an AVP for everyone in your household.‚Äù

And there‚Äôs something standoffish about one person in a household being physically present but at the same time being deep in a virtual world that can‚Äôt be shared with others in the room with you."
2025-02-22T18:49:26Z,"I hate the hate this product gets. Do I have one? No. I have been in the VR space since DK1 though. Quest 3 and VR in general got a whole lot better because of the AVP. The problem with most headsets today is there are usually 1 or 2 positives with a lot more compromises. The AVP has almost no compromises except price. Their decision to use premium more heavy materials was not the best decision. I really wish they would consider nylon composites and gels but I doubt it. 

I‚Äôm pretty confident I will purchase the next generation AVP. I just hope they make the best headset possible and another headset for a more approachable entry price. Sadly then all we are going to get is complaints about the compromises on a cheaper model."
2025-02-22T22:39:07Z,Dude doesn‚Äôt know what the word ‚Äúpost mortem‚Äù means.
2025-02-22T22:56:51Z,God these thumbnails are nauseating.
2025-02-22T18:35:26Z,[deleted]
2025-02-22T18:37:36Z,"Hardly dead yet though, is it?"
2025-02-22T22:41:38Z,"This whole discussion is so idiotic. Apple never made the thing for casual consumers, yet casual consumers are griping and declaring it dead."
2025-02-22T18:42:15Z,"If it were priced like a Studio Display, it‚Äôd practically be a no-brainer.¬†
Honestly a headset that was just meant for connecting to your Mac/iPad/iPhone as a display extension would be amazing. It doesn‚Äôt need its own ecosystem, just make it an accessory.¬†"
2025-02-22T19:55:59Z,"So as we were saying since the reveal - too heavy to replace iPhone, too limited to replace computers, $3500 for a very unclear use case - just like iPad Pro. I wonder what lessons Apple takes from it and how AVP 2 would look like."
2025-02-22T20:02:59Z,"Amazing technology, but impractical and vastly overpriced."
2025-02-23T17:02:47Z,"Yikes‚Ä¶ well thank you, I had been eyeballing this for the past couple of days"
2025-02-23T17:27:18Z,Belkin 3 in 1 charger will always be the best one. I've had the 2nd gen model for over 2 years now with 0 issues. Current model is 3rd gen: try it out.
2025-02-23T19:09:58Z,I‚Äôve also had good luck with anything made by Anker
2025-02-23T21:07:48Z,"Which one do you use? Personally I don't like the Anker ones. The cube is too small for a nightstand and I don't like how the watch charger is behind the phone. I want to be able to see everything. The other bigger one has the phone way above the watch, which just looks uneven and not uniform. And I believe one of them only charges at 7.5 watts, which is just too slow. Belkin does 15 watts ever since Gen 2."
2025-02-22T17:52:50Z,The massive achievement is being able to produce their own 5g modem while bypassing (I assume) Qualcomms multitude of wireless patents.
2025-02-22T18:35:19Z,They had to buy intel‚Äôs wireless division for their patents
2025-02-22T19:25:53Z,"Right, I forgot about that. Let‚Äôs hope they‚Äôve improved upon them!"
2025-02-22T22:03:15Z,Apple‚Äôs beef with Qualcomm‚Äôs % of device sale price licensing model runs so deep they don‚Äôt even care about the cost of independence.
2025-02-24T10:00:38Z,"it was proved though that they did right by changing to AS, from Nvidia to AMD , and from Qualcomm chips to their own for iPhones (back in the day).   
So although it costs short-term , they make those money back tenfold."
2025-02-23T10:01:56Z,Which is ironic that they basically switched to Intel after dumping intel as chip manufacturer for their Macs.
2025-02-23T11:07:24Z,"you get your timeline all wrong. Apple started using an Intel modem in 2016 with iPhone 7 series. in April 2019, Intel said that they would exit the 5G modem business, and in July of the same year, Apple bought the Intel modem division. arm Macbook aren't released until November 2020

so Apple bought Intel network division, and later dumped Intel chips."
2025-02-22T23:59:58Z,"Apple paid $1B for Intel's modem division. I've read that Apple pays Qualcomm somewhere around $8B+ each year for modems.

You can do a LOT of modem design work for that kind of money."
2025-02-23T12:39:56Z,"The problem is they are paying for both right now. 

$1B to buy Intel chip division. Probably $1-2B a year in payroll (they brought over all 2,200 employees!) and development. Test equipment. Commitments to fabrication.  

Not to mention the Qualcomm licensing prepayment of $4B at the same time when they dropped their lawsuits. And the ongoing per device cost. 

So yes, you better know pretty confidently you can lower the per device cost by 50% and match quality."
2025-02-23T17:45:11Z,"TBH Intel's wifi division is probably the only department that is of value. Their current wireless chips for PCs are top quality. Far superior to Mediatek and Realtek.

Apple likely got one hell of a deal picking at the corpse of Intel."
2025-02-23T18:01:27Z,Their GPU division caught up to last gen Nvidia entry level after just a single generation. That is pretty impressive.
2025-02-23T00:36:48Z,"They‚Äòre not bypassing them, they‚Äòre licensing them. (those that are standard essential patents, SEPs).  

Just like Qualcomm also has to license other companies SEPs. 

And yes, Apple‚Äòs has also started (since the intel mobile business takeover?) to take part in 3GPP standard setting and development and building up its own portfolio of SEPs for cross licensing."
2025-02-22T19:25:00Z,Not having to pay the Qualcomm fee will lower the phones prices right ? Right ?
2025-02-22T22:55:23Z,"Consumer benefit will be from tighter integration and power savings. I‚Äôm imagining a situation in which C(x) devices can communicate with each other and potentially create a mesh network that could allow messaging without having access to a cellular signal. Kind of how the FindMy Network leverages any Apple devices nearby to ping a location. 

Think of AirDrop but cranked up to allow iMessage, FaceTime audio/video with people near you with no wifi data or Cellular data connection needed. I‚Äôm probably missing something here because I don‚Äôt know this tech well enough."
2025-02-23T04:55:16Z,"there's zero indication they're working on anything like this lol

Apple's modem still connects to regular cell towers like normal."
2025-02-23T05:38:45Z,"Which is why I put C(x) I‚Äôm referring to a future version of this. If it‚Äôs possible who knows but maybe it was on a whiteboard somewhere at Apple Park.

Like FindMy using BT to ping off every single Apple device to create the mesh network for locations. Was there any indication they were using a normal BT radio for this purpose? It took the market by surprise."
2025-02-23T09:18:23Z,The problem is that people could use that network for protests eg. in China and Apple already had to restrict airdrop for example for that reason.
2025-02-23T17:19:06Z,Ooof I forgot about this.
2025-02-23T13:00:19Z,What are your insights into the potential feature sets of future cellular chips from Apple? I genuinely want to know.
2025-02-23T12:46:32Z,"I actually really appreciate this forward thinking.

I forgot the 4G and 5G standards already contemplate this functionality! This feature was added to LTE starting with Release 12 of the 3GPP specifications, via the Proximity Services (ProSe), and further extended in Release 13. 5G was to add ProSe to 5G New Radio (NR) by leveraging the device to device capabilities in the standard called NR sidelink!

Of course there was also enhanced mobility broadband (eMBB) which may be the feature set needed here to serve some of these more data rich functions.

I‚Äôll join you in the thinking for fun. 

1. What if they were able to do something like capacity or coverage sharing. Pick the device in your location that has the best signal?

2. What if they used sidelink to be more what the walkie talkie features on Apple Watch were supposed to be? Think  no latency communications with somewhat disparate friends (more like a two way radio?)

3. They enable Vehicle to Pedestrians in CarPlay for collision avoidance. Or Vehicle to vehicle via phones for better traffic optimization and routing on maps. 

4. Extend the distance and capability of Airdrop to other devices by adding it to the 5G sidelink standard? Some Qualcomm chips teased this feature in the past.

5. You could FaceTime or livestream content to other devices locally. Think families at a sporting event or concert but not sitting together. Of course broaden the impact of find my in these areas."
2025-02-23T17:18:40Z,"You definitely know more about this tech than I do. 1, 4, and 5 is definitely where my mind was going. With integration like this I‚Äôm curious to see how far, if at all, Apple can take this with software and hardware. If in 3 years a Cx modem is in nearly every Apple device they sell they could certainly leverage that."
2025-02-24T03:37:03Z,"I like the way you‚Äôre thinking on this.

My crazy idea is that they are also looking into further integrating satellite tech down the line"
2025-02-23T00:02:41Z,I'd guess that they plan on using the (massive) vertical integration saving to avoid a massive price hike from tariffs.
2025-02-23T15:16:51Z,"Seeing what apple charges for ram and storage upgrade options there is zero chance of this. Also Qualcomm is leaps and bounds ahead of Apple in this space, they're probably a solid decade away from ever catching up if that's even possible. So you'll most likely be paying the same for something Apple spins as a good thing when it's not as good lol"
2025-02-22T22:53:52Z,"if even it was the case, the tariffs will probably push the price right back up"
2025-02-23T12:41:03Z,Once we pay off all that non zero R&amp;D cost over the last 5 years. And the intel modem business acquisition.
2025-02-22T20:45:26Z,"I do wonder if there were any patents that were licensed here, from Qualcomm or elsewhere. There could be patents licensed under FRAND terms, or there could be a private deal with some company to license them at $$$$."
2025-02-22T15:27:57Z,People seem so sceptical about the C1 modem like I doubt the average customer looking to get the 16e even knows about it. I‚Äôm on the optimistic side that it‚Äôll succeed and Apple likely spent many years on developing this modem. The long battery life of the 16e likely has to do with both the better modem and A18 chip.
2025-02-22T20:48:59Z,"I'm pretty confident it will work ""well enough,"" but I also expect a lot of corner-case bugs to get fixed in the next 24 months. Once these get out into the real world, there will be lots of small issues that they find and add to their QA process to test for in future versions.

In short, it's perfect to launch this with the 16e, and I wouldn't expect a C-series chip in a flagship iPhone until the 18 series."
2025-02-23T13:05:38Z,"They brought over 2,200 engineers from the intel modem team, these people aren‚Äôt doing it for the first time."
2025-02-24T12:13:45Z,It‚Äôs purported to be in all the 17 series
2025-02-22T18:14:42Z,"Whether or not it it‚Äôs good, it will not really be all that much of a game changer for the user. If it matches, or even exceeds, the efficiency of Qualcomm‚Äôs end users will probably not notice much benefit. What will happen, is apple will be able to bring down their cost of manufacturing. So good for them and investors.¬†"
2025-02-23T17:48:06Z,"Yep and we won‚Äôt see a price cut at all, maybe they‚Äôll silently phase out it costing more to add cellular on iPads or Apple Watches (maybe even MacBooks), but we all fucking know the several billions they save is going straight into some pockets.

Nothing to really cheer for except it potentially benefiting us one day with some ‚Äúit just works‚Äù feature."
2025-02-24T04:13:46Z,"Considering inflation, not seeing a price increase these last few years is impressive. I thought we would see a price hike by now"
2025-02-22T18:28:40Z,It's the indirect benefit mainly like Apple being able to advertise a significantly improved battery life over people upgrading from the SE or 11 so your summary sums it up.
2025-02-24T12:14:23Z,It will use less power than Qualcomm
2025-02-23T17:42:50Z,"My confidence in Apple nosedived after all the AI stuff, they‚Äôre just off their game lately with a ton of major product line changing things starting but not resulting in much outside of the M-chip‚Äôs success.

They‚Äôre kinda in a ‚ÄúI‚Äôll believe it when I see it‚Äù state for me. But the fact they‚Äôre charging a lot more on the phone it‚Äôs debuting in just to be the first public beta testers while they slowly roll it out, isn‚Äôt inspiring confidence."
2025-02-24T01:09:26Z,Not having the camera or the magnets also allows for a physically larger battery
2025-02-24T12:13:10Z,Well it‚Äôs based on intels modem business that Apple bought. When Apple tried intel modems on the iPhone 7 it was a disaster. They never have repeated that mistake until now. Hopefully they have improved the tech a lot in the interim.
2025-02-22T18:33:00Z,Let's wait for benchmarks and see if it performs better or worse than Qualcomm's designs.
2025-02-22T23:02:22Z,"Impressive to make a nearly 10m video with ""behind the scenes"" access and not manage to glean a single technical detail about the thing other than ""it doesn't have mmwave.""

Good thing I know what a cellular processor does... it processes cellular data."
2025-02-23T23:01:14Z,"Finding YouTube videos with actual hard data is one in a million. Most idiots just babble on in intros and old info and ""we will discuss ABC in this video!"" bullshit"
2025-02-22T12:31:38Z,"I'm curious and excited.

I'm also in the need of a new phone sooner than later, and for very specific reasons I'll need to stick to iPhones for probably the next handful of years.

Now... for me cheaper is better and I don't care much about the lost features.

# BUT...

I'm also not a complete Apple newbie... and ""version 1.0"" Apple products aren't exactly famous for being stable.  I've been burned by 1.0 products from them before, so I'll wait as long as I can before replacing my phone with either this or like base 15.

A version 1.0 of their first cellphone antenna gives me pause."
2025-02-22T12:47:05Z,"Are you referring to the C1 as version 1.0?

Fwiw my M1 macbook air still works great over 4 years later. And the R1 in the AVP is great at what it does."
2025-02-22T14:22:40Z,"Apple had a near decade of CPU and GPU design experience with the M1 from its A series chips. The M1 was really an upscaling and evolution of those chips.¬†

Apple‚Äôs never done a cellular modem before and the roll out of this chip has hit a lot of delays, so clearly they had a lot of issues getting it working. Maybe it‚Äôll be fine, maybe it won‚Äôt, but I don‚Äôt think the M1 is a great comparison.¬†"
2025-02-23T00:07:24Z,"Intel bought Infineon's modem division for $1.4B in 2011. Those already experienced guys worked on modems for Intel then got purchased from Intel for $1B in 2019. This is around 6 years more work on top of that (and paying top dollar to recruit talent from other places).

That's not a guarantee that it works, but that's a ton of time and investment into a known problem to have absolutely worthless results too."
2025-02-22T16:58:04Z,"Agreed. Between the C1, upcoming new wifi chip and the 17 Pro series going back to aluminum from titanium, I'm really glad I got my 16 Pro Max. Keeping it for 5 years just like my 11 Pro Max before it anyways but happy all the bugs, issues etc will be worked out long before I upgrade."
2025-02-22T14:58:57Z,I kinda feel like the A12X/Z was like the M0. We can only hope that the iPhone XS modem was like the C0 and this is a big improvement.
2025-02-22T17:19:14Z,"It sure was, in essence"
2025-02-22T13:06:35Z,"I don't think the introduction of C1 and M1 are comparable. Apple had a lot of experience working on iPhone chips before they moved Macs over to M. C1 is basically a new frontier for them. This is a very complicated field that Qualcomm has a several decade head start on. There's a reason Apple are testing it on a cheaper, non-mainstream model first instead of launching it with the next pro."
2025-02-22T16:38:36Z,M1 was a more powerful version of the A-series mobile chip that¬¥s been around since 2010. It was a direct successor to the A12Z Bionic. It is not a 1.0 product
2025-02-22T12:52:03Z,"Yeh, I'm referring to the C1 as the 1.0 product I'm concerned about.  

I've been burned before.  A redesigned iMac a while back had a major flaw that I experienced; bad enough I had to return it.  A redesigned MacBook Pro a **while** back had a keyboard issue that literally took multiple years to resolve.  etc.

Unfortunately I'm in an are where signals vary between great and crap-tastic.  And I don't know how well the new antenna will do in the more crappy areas."
2025-02-22T13:03:55Z,"I am very curious as well considering Qualcomm also makes most of the tower radios which is why their modems do so well in high congestion conditions. They basically cornered the market for this pairing for a very long time and across multiple territories. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if they ‚Äúpoisoned the well‚Äù by making sure non-Qualcomm equipment is somehow deprioritized or hindered at the hardware when attempting to connect to their towers. This game is a dirty business of ‚Äòhe who monopolizes first, wins‚Äô. But, if Apple does manage to engineer a good, power efficient modem then we can look forward to some nice battery life gains with no perceivable loss in connectivity."
2025-02-22T13:42:48Z,I thought that Ericsson and Samsung were used for radios on cell towers? And Nokia but they‚Äôre being phased out
2025-02-22T13:54:58Z,"If they are paying Qualcom royalties, their are using Qualcom protocols. Many countries are also phasing out Huawei and buying new future-proof 5G equipment predominantly from Qualcomm or using their protocols."
2025-02-22T17:59:32Z,"My M1 and AVP have been flawless.

The W1 chip in all the first gen Airpods worked flawlessly.

Apple has many first gen internal components that work very well and are reliable."
2025-02-22T18:02:40Z,"M1 was a logical progression / evolution from working on iphone/ipad cpu's forever.

Modems would be something rather new.

Meanwhile I guess I've been unlucky since a bunch of 1st revision attempts at new fields have given me hardware issues."
2025-02-22T17:18:40Z,"I'm also not a complete Apple newbie... and ""version 1.0"" Apple products aren't exactly famous for being stable. I've been burned by 1.0 products from them before, so I'll wait as long as I can before replacing my phone with either this or like base 15.

&gt;A version 1.0 of their first cellphone antenna gives me pause.

As some who bought a 1st-gen Macbook Pro with Touchbar, I agree fully."
2025-02-22T15:56:43Z,I can think of very few Apple products ‚Äú1.0‚Äù that didn‚Äôt work well.
2025-02-22T18:39:24Z,"For me the 1.0 is more about abandonment time than functionality. Some of them definitely did have limited capability vs. where the product line went just a generation later, but they generally worked well for their purposes.

Apple made *one generation* of a computers: The Macintosh TV, the ""AV"" Macs (660AV, 840AV), the eMate, the Pippin. I got to play with speech processing on the 660AV. One generation of *many* accessories, too.

First-gen Intel Macs were 32-bit Core Solo &amp; Duo processors, which did not support 64-bit processing and dropped OS support in two years while receiving few capabilities of the ""supported"" macOS upgrades.

First-gen iPhone was 2G, stopped major OS updates in 3 years.

First-gen AppleTV was an Intel-based system (could even be converted into a Mac mini) which was totally replaced with the A-series black box style. They provided limited support for services from it, but it was basically abandoned.

First-gen iPad dropped new OS support in two years. 

First-gen Apple Watch was later referred to as the ""Series Zero"" and received virtually no feature enhancements over time. Basically a dead product in a year, official OS support dropped in 3 years.

First-gen HomePod still works well, but they discontinued it, switching to the HomePod mini exclusively for a few years before adding it back to the lineup. This is a bit of a stretch, to be fair.

I recall the first-gen iPods didn't get the same updates as even the ""second release"" first-gen (10GB option), but I can't find evidence of that, so this may be my incorrect recollection.

The C1 is a second or third generation modem, based on the Intel tech they bought and used previously. I would be less concerned about it being abandoned quickly than the AVP."
2025-02-23T01:28:59Z,If cheaper is important and you don‚Äôt want the latest your best bet would be to buy an older gen.¬†
2025-02-23T08:47:55Z,"Meh.

I don't want to go second hand, since my brother had a bunch of issues going second hand.

So I am considering going with a base-line iPhone 15, except my friend was having a lot of overheating issues with his to the point that he switched to Android.  But he might have simply been unlucky.

I have to stick with iPhone platform for at least the next handful of years due to family reasons.  My current phone is 5 years old: scratched and dinged to hell, and the battery isn't doing great.  And since it's an iPhone 12 mini, the battery was already small to begin with."
2025-02-22T13:22:57Z,I doubt the C1 is on par with Qualcomm yet.
2025-02-22T20:39:50Z,"It‚Äôs not, they openly admitted they wanted better battery life than to match the performance of Qualcomm."
2025-02-23T03:28:47Z,If it delivers slower network speeds but better battery life it will get slammed in the reviews.
2025-02-22T13:31:31Z,"I really like how it's been mentioned that it can network traffic prioritize working alongside with the A18, prioritizing certain apps and current opened apps and deprioritizing background apps to obtain the best data speeds while in a congested network area."
2025-02-22T14:13:16Z,The current chips do this already
2025-02-22T18:23:11Z,Apple already strangles then puts to sleep background apps extremely quickly. I don't know how much this matters.
2025-02-23T04:21:04Z,by god that‚Äôs cellular macs‚Äô music
2025-02-22T22:55:01Z,Bit boring that the cool tour was just cut down to tiny clips of b-roll. I'd like to have heard it from Jonny Srouji himself.
2025-02-23T05:06:46Z,Wouldn't be surprised if Apple PR prevented him from actually playing any of their conversations lol
2025-02-23T02:27:04Z,Yes terrible video. I scrubbed through specifically looking for the actual tour and not the boilerplate filler
2025-02-22T16:38:15Z,Anyone else want Apple to release a new airport range now that they have this out??
2025-02-23T19:56:29Z,God i‚Äôd love a new AirPort Extreme and express
2025-02-23T03:25:52Z,"25% better efficiency? If they achieved that in tests because download speeds are lower, I‚Äôm okay with it. Most people don‚Äôt mind the difference between 50Mb and 400Mb download speeds. However, I‚Äôm concerned about coverage. Will the 16e still be able to make calls and (slowly) load a website with poor coverage? Qualcomm modems have significantly improved in this scenario over the years.

Remember reading that Apple still has to pay Qualcomm royalties, even though they're now making their own C1."
2025-02-23T17:43:08Z,[They entered an agreement with Qualcomm until March 2027.](https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/31/apple-extends-qualcomm-modem-licensing-deal/) By that time I imagine they will not need to extend the agreement any further. They will be on C3/C4 by then.
2025-02-22T19:17:17Z,Looking forward to the battery life impact this could have on the 17pro max....
2025-02-22T16:27:19Z,Weren‚Äôt iPhones using intel modems a few years ago but had reception issues which is why they went to qualcomm. The first few Apple modem iPhones might have the same problems. Which is probably why they are launching with the 16E.
2025-02-22T22:55:00Z,"Apple might get it right better than Intel

Intel's problem was bloated management filled with tech-illiterate MBAs telling engineers what to do"
2025-02-22T20:04:18Z,"I hope this works out, it would mean an end to qualcomm monopoly and abuses."
2025-02-22T17:12:21Z,"Can't wait for the fourth generation, it's going to be a blast!"
2025-02-22T13:44:05Z,"Yeah, I‚Äôll be waiting for 2-3 years before I buy any of apple‚Äôs new phones. I don‚Äôt want to be their lab rat for their first gen modems."
2025-02-22T19:44:57Z,"Not the same category, but people said this about the M1 and look how that turned out."
2025-02-22T19:11:58Z,Although curious if say America gets Qualcomm chips while rest of world doesn‚Äôt eventually because Qualcomm has the lock on mmWave patents
2025-02-23T01:22:17Z,I don‚Äôt actually think mmWave is going to be a thing on iPhones in a couple of years. It was ahead of its time and it isn‚Äôt really practical.
2025-02-23T05:14:33Z,The rumor is that the C2 modem next year will have mmWave.

2025-02-22T20:51:04Z,Look for something similar to happen in the future with the Wifi/Bluetooth/NFC chips. These are currently supplied by Broadcom.
2025-02-23T02:51:44Z,I'm wondering if this will be the beginning for Apple to bring cellular connectivity to more device types like MacBook and Vision Pro.
2025-02-23T13:55:23Z,"Wait until the phone is out, people will test it. Better to do that than to read this fluff piece"
2025-02-23T17:56:10Z,My old team! This is the work of years and will only get better. So incredibly proud of these guys.
2025-02-23T21:49:28Z,"Hey all, you dont need to get excited about this. The whole point here is to increase profit margins on their phone.


You won't notice a difference that's distinguishable from placebo effect as a user unless apple fucks up a firmware update and you end up with a lemonphone that gets a replacement program 6 years and 600 deleted apple.com support threads later."
2025-02-24T04:04:52Z,"Definitely will just be saving Apple on costs, but could be interesting to see what possibilities it opens up. For me, I'd love to see cellular connectivity in a MacBook, as well as true implementation of DSDA. The Qualcomm chips support DSDA now, but maybe Apple will be more incentivized to add that support into iOS with their own chips."
2025-02-22T21:12:02Z,"Good. In a world where our economy depends more and more on mobile apps, it doesn't make sense for Apple to have a monopoly to tax it."
2025-02-22T21:20:08Z,They can keep their App Store. It‚Äôs just high time they‚Äôre not allowed to restrict people into only buying from the App Store. I should be able to download apps off github and other places to install on my iPhone and iPad the way I do on my Mac.
2025-02-23T03:56:05Z,"No, because then some App Store is going to pay for exclusivity for a popular app and consumers are going to be forced to choose between downloading off a dodgy site with spyware and malware or not using the app. The reason for using the Apple ecosystem is for privacy and safety.

Typical baseless fearmongering bullshit. Show me this happening on Android. Alternative stores are literally a tiny niche and the malicious apps are still installed from the Play Store. When you‚Äôre done clutching your pearls, *you* should stop forcing your preferences down the rest of our throats."
2025-02-23T13:49:11Z,"If it hasn‚Äôt happened on app stores yet, it‚Äôs only a matter of time. I can show you a million examples of exclusivity agreements happening elsewhere, streaming most prominently. Now I have a dozen streaming services for all of my shows. I have to get YouTube tv if I want Sunday ticket, etc. Also look at console gaming. I can‚Äôt just buy one console and then be able to buy any game. 

I‚Äôm literally not forcing anything because that‚Äôs how things are and have been. You‚Äôre the one trying to make changes. There is already a choice for you, you‚Äôre just being selfish by making a choice and then trying to make that choice change instead of just making the other choice that‚Äôs already set up that way. Enjoy your Samsung and leave us alone. PLEASE."

That‚Äôs how an actual free market works? You want a monopoly where one provider controls the market and you are beholden to them? Hey, at least they‚Äôll have everything and you‚Äôll be left without choice."
2025-02-24T12:50:10Z,"No, I want to be able to buy Hulu and have the option to add Sunday ticket instead of being forced to buy YouTube tv to have access to Sunday ticket. Before Fubo TV sold, they had all the best soccer channels but I couldn‚Äôt buy it because I had to buy YouTube tv for Sunday ticket. Exclusivity agreements are anti free market pal."
2025-02-24T16:02:04Z,"&gt;	Exclusivity agreements are anti free market pal.

They are not. They are what happens in an unregulated free market. Just like the inevitable monopolies and cartels.

If you want to ban exclusivity agreements then you should message your representatives, not hope a monopoly will fix this for you."
2025-02-24T17:45:16Z,Unregulated free market is redundant. Free markets have no restrictions.
2025-02-24T17:51:39Z,"Only if you have an elementary education on economics and still believe things should be based on 19th century theories.

You can regulate for a free market. Applying antitrust laws is exactly that."
2025-02-23T07:27:15Z,"Just take a look at what Epic is doing with its store. They‚Äôve been the easiest example on Windows and now that they‚Äôre on mobile, they‚Äôve removed Rocket League Sideswipe from Google Play and the EU App Store to make it exclusive to EGS Mobile."
2025-02-23T10:58:14Z,"It makes no financial sense for a company to release an app for both a 3rd party marketplace and on the AppStore. 

If a developer decides to release it on both, they will need to pay the CTF for both the marketplace and the AppStore. 

Apple currently does not have a mechanism on the AppStore to charge ‚Ç¨0.50 per install per year, whereas it is possible for the marketplace. This is just to cover the fee that Apple imposed on developers.

If anything, it‚Äôs Apple who is encouraging developers to only release on one store on iOS."
2025-02-23T16:52:00Z,There‚Äôs a lot of things that Epic does that don‚Äôt make financial sense.
2025-02-23T13:54:13Z,"Exclusivity means it won‚Äôt be released on both, that‚Äôs the point. App Store X says to the developer, release only on my store and I‚Äôll charge you 5%. Developer releases only on that store and not on the regular App Store. That isn‚Äôt likely to happen until a side store gets enough traction, but it‚Äôs only a matter of time. We see it everyday in other areas, streaming, console gaming, etc. Or developers will release on their own sites and there‚Äôs absolutely no check for spyware or malware or any oversight at all."
2025-02-23T08:31:48Z,"&gt;Stop wanting to have your cake and eat it too by forcing your preferences down the rest of our throats.

On the Mac, you have the option to download apps from everywhere, or just the App Store. Somehow it works out just fine."
2025-02-23T13:56:22Z,"I always check the Mac App Store first and I wish everything had an app on there like iOS, but unfortunately that‚Äôs not the case. Ask any IT person how well it works to let people download shit off the internet lol."
2025-02-23T21:13:45Z,"I am an IT person. It works perfectly fine. Except for morons who still click on every link they see in an email. You can't fix stupid, and it's silly to punish everyone for the actions of the stupid."
2025-02-23T22:32:01Z,"I‚Äôd rather not have to worry about it. If you want that on your phone I don‚Äôt understand why you just don‚Äôt get an android. Serious question. There are benefits to the Apple walled garden that some of us like, so it‚Äôs not like we want it to stay for no reason. Why not just use the system that works the way you say you want? Changing Apple would mean no choice for those of us who don‚Äôt want to change while you have a choice right now."
2025-02-24T00:53:36Z,"Why doesn't Apple just make macOS App Store only and cut off third-party downloading on that platform, too? That way you don't have to worry about malware or viruses."
2025-02-24T00:56:53Z,That‚Äôs what I said two comments up lol.
2025-02-24T14:46:10Z,"So how about you stop downloading apps from outside of app store on Mac and stop forcing your preferences down our throats? Follow your vision of apple monopoly and stop installing apps this haram way. Do us a service and don't use a Mac, you knew how it works. Buy an ipad and you will have your closed down ecosystem.

If you think my comment is stupid, try to read yours. At least mine is satire"
2025-02-24T15:18:07Z,"The major differences are 1) I‚Äôm not advocating for a regulatory change regarding Mac. I just stated my preference, but it is how it is. And 2) there is no other choice like that already for Mac. If there was a windows option like that already, I‚Äôd have a choice and I could buy a windows computer. So, I think I‚Äôm being logically consistent."
2025-02-24T15:34:44Z,"But you have the choice not to use apps distributed outside of app store and yet you choose to use them despite your preferences. You can stay consistent and not use these apps. But you need these apps you tell me. Well great, I need sideloaded apps that I can't get with current Apple policies on iOS.

Apple having monopoly is absolutely wrong. You can see from clear example of Play Store that there will not be any fragmentation. Android had sideloading since the beginning and yet there are no common apps that would be exclusive to some 3rd party store. How do you think that will play out on a platform that is already established like App Store where 99% would never download a 3rd party store? 90% would refuse to even follow instructions to install an alternative store from the web if they had clear step by step instructions and the rest will not want to.

There is no worthwhile app you would lose or system security you would compromise by allowing optional sideloading with enough guardrails. None."
2025-02-24T17:43:46Z,"If I had the option to use only secure apps, I would. But that‚Äôs not an option no matter what system I use. So I do it and don‚Äôt complain about it. 

Why do you need sideloaded apps? Why not use the phone browser for things that don‚Äôt have an app? Unless you‚Äôre saying that once there are other app stores, people are going to make apps for them. 

I don‚Äôt care if they lower pricing, they probably should, that‚Äôs not what this topic is about. This topic is about a uniform App Store that has checks for privacy, spyware, malware, etc. I don‚Äôt care if Apple makes 30% or 3%. 

It wouldn‚Äôt happen right away that a 3rd party store would do that, but once it got more market share, it could. The more likely scenario is a company forcing people to download from its own mobile website, like an Epic Games."
2025-02-24T08:25:28Z,"Just like the Mac? Which is an Apple product? In the Apple ecosystem?

No one is forcing you to buy an app that isn‚Äôt available in the App Store. Apple (and you) are forcing me to buy from the App Store."
2025-02-24T12:47:38Z,"You can choose an android so no one is forcing you to do anything. 

I‚Äôd love it if the Mac only had apps."
2025-02-22T22:03:38Z,"Also the restriction where they ban developers from communicating their prices outside the App Store, which may be substantially cheaper: about $50/creator/year for Patreon for instance, which is an absolute scam considering they also forced Patreon to exclusively use IAP."
2025-02-23T00:19:08Z,That's exactly what I hope for!
2025-02-23T08:29:45Z,Imagine being told how you‚Äôre allowed to use the device you paid an astronomical amount for

2025-02-22T04:22:13Z,"Sorry, I think this would be incredible."
2025-02-22T02:37:23Z,"I think he would deserve it. But his accomplishments only happened with teams of extraordinarily talented people. 

In the history of the US there are so many inventors that worked alone and changed the world.    

Eli Whitney, Samuel Morse, Isaac Singer, Nikola Tesla, Philo Farnsworth all did more with less.  And it seems to me they all made an impact on the world of similar magnitude as Jobs."
2025-02-22T03:18:57Z,"Steve Jobs said as much repeatedly, in public. One of his last major interviews at All Things D in 2010 was a lot about Apple, how it works, and what the future is about. It‚Äôs like an hour and half long, and some of it isn‚Äôt on that topic, but it‚Äôs worth watching.

I think it‚Äôs also telling how he viewed himself in the context of Apple‚Äôs success all the way in 2010. He wrote a note to himself (in email form) about how he views himself that no one saw. Especially¬†today, with the exception of Apple and Tim Cook, I don‚Äôt see anyone in technology that thinks like that.

2025-02-22T04:35:55Z,"I mostly agree. But Jobs wasn‚Äôt really an inventor like those guys. His genius was in vision and leadership, not technical invention. He needed a team to bring his ideas to life. Tesla and the others were brilliant individual inventors and might be more deserving in that sense, but I doubt they could have stepped into Jobs‚Äô role and achieved the same kind of success."
2025-02-22T12:08:45Z,Steve would have hated this.

2025-02-22T02:22:13Z,How about Woz?
2025-02-22T02:26:35Z,"Dude, Woz was involved with the co-founding of Apple and Apple 1/2, but literally past that he has had nothing to do with modern Apple products including Mac. I like him a lot and respect what he contributed, but to say Wozniak should be on a coin and not Steve Jobs seems really strange given that Jobs was literally involved with the rebirth of Apple 1997."
2025-02-22T03:02:27Z,"seeing Woz shilling shitty startups to make a buck the last decade or so has been so sad

but yeah the guy is a great example that being a technical genius at one point in time is no guarantee of future success, and that teaming up with great collaborators is what can really make or break your success"
2025-02-22T03:08:45Z,"&gt;that¬†teaming up with great collaborators is what can really make or break your success.

Absolutely! And Steve Jobs said that as much ‚Äî that he is only one person, and that it‚Äôs the team effort that accomplishes things. He likened Apple to the Beatles, and he said that while all 4 were great musicians in their own, it was all of them together that equaled more than the sum of its parts. That, and constantly bumping up against one another to vigorously debate a topic to make sure what they were doing was actually good.¬†

There's a really great note (in email form) Steve Jobs wrote to himself on his iPad. It‚Äôs on the Steve Jobs Archive website. He never sent it to anyone, only himself. So it‚Äôs a very nice look into how he thought about himself in the context of Apple‚Äôs success. And especially today, with the exception of Apple and Tim Cook, I don‚Äôt see anyone in technology that thinks like that.

The guy who basically told you that he thought you were stupid by walking into your conversation and asking to ""elevate the discourse"".

Stories are too numerous and of different veracity, but we know Nolan Bushnell paid him to reduce the transistor count on arcade games by 20%, and Jobs simply outsourced the actual work to Woz (who went beyond  and reduced the count by something like 60% because of course he did) and Jobs gave him 10% of the money. Woz wouldn't find out for decades (like, after Steve's return to the company) until having lunch with Bushnell."

2025-02-22T01:48:15Z,"Still have my M1 as well. 

Apple will purposely not upgrade the Air's display until the Pro gets an even better display first."
2025-02-22T04:57:39Z,M1 really is a killer machine
2025-02-22T16:55:25Z,Yeah its been solid. I am a pretty basic computer user. Just browsing chatting etc. I dont do anything heavy. As long as apple keeps updating the OS i am onboard to keep holding out.
2025-02-22T18:26:58Z,"it‚Äôs been more than enough for my casual use case. 

getting the upgrade to 16GB memory has served me really well. 

now if only it will have less bezels and a modern slightly rounded corner display to help keep up with current laptop standards"
2025-02-22T20:20:44Z,Tim did say he thought you would love it
2025-02-23T07:17:45Z,"Honestly I think apple regret it but they are locked in now, m chips are all hilariouly overkill and apple decided to put them in everything 

The reel world different moving from M1 to M4 is basically nothing for 90% of people, especially people who bought an air just because they are used to having a Mac

If you are just doing normal workloads, there will be no reason to upgrade really, hell even if you do light moderate amounts of video and photo edits, the benefits probably aren't worth the upgrade cost."
2025-02-23T19:14:59Z,"Id say it‚Äôs that way for just about everyone. I‚Äôm a heavy Logic Pro user and have to work with insanely large data files from time to time for work, and I‚Äôve yet to have an issue with my M1 *knocks on wood*"
2025-02-22T11:42:47Z,Yeah it does the job!
2025-02-22T12:44:38Z,The MBP has had a better (120Hz HDR) display for a while now.  It‚Äôs why I got the base level MBP instead.
2025-02-22T11:14:09Z,"That‚Äôs fine with me. I‚Äôve had the M1 MacBook Air for four years now and I don‚Äôt see myself upgrading unless I get a cool new display.

Most of us don‚Äôt do anything with a computer that requires any CPU power beyond a smart phone."
2025-02-22T17:24:15Z,"I know it‚Äôs less in Apples control, but becoming a player in the gaming market would change this for them. I think a smart move would be creating their own division that specializes in native AAA games for their M-series chips. That‚Äôd really show off their power and entice more people to upgrade / migrate for portable power. I think they were discussing a partnership with Nintendo years ago, though it didn‚Äôt workout."
2025-02-22T18:41:00Z,"You are right, if they would ever manage to get into the gaming space, that would be very interesting. The problem I see is that Apple wants the gaming to happen on their mobile devices, via the App Store. That is the only way how Apple can truly profit off of the gaming market‚Ä¶ and the app market is also the market by game developers are only producing gotcha games for iPad and iPhone.

True pro gaming will remain with desktop PCs and dedicated GPUs. You will only get mid-range gaming out of the laptop and tablet range from Apple. Without high-end gaming, there is only the console style type of games left and those were probably remain on the consoles."
2025-02-22T15:44:25Z,"&gt; Apple will purposely not upgrade the Air's display until the Pro gets an even better display first.

Well that's probably the only thing that would get me looking at a new macbook pro, I like the screen on my m1 max now but I'd be much happier with a qd oled."
2025-02-22T15:26:06Z,Better displays cost more. What you‚Äôre really saying is that Apple will never significantly increase the BOM for the Air because it would push the retail price higher than this segment will buy.
2025-02-22T06:53:04Z,If your own an M1/2/3 machine really no reason to upgrade until the next major redesign.
2025-02-22T21:34:24Z,I got a bare bones M2 Air. Really would like to have more than 8gb ram and 256gb storage for the 3 times a year I have to open up Premiere or After Effects
2025-02-22T18:18:24Z,My m1 pro is still a beast for what I use it for.
2025-02-22T15:12:50Z,I‚Äôm still holding out with my Intel MacBook over here üòÇ
2025-02-22T17:10:40Z,"Intel i think its too far back. Youre not getting any software updates and features. i saw the m1 on sale for like 450. At this time though, i think m2+  would be better  for the upgraded webcam i tihnk they also added magsafe (i need to verify, dont remember) . M1 camera is potato quality."
2025-02-22T18:18:22Z,Same here. I have a gaming PC for more demanding tasks so the M1 will probably be perfectly fine for the next few years
2025-02-23T00:28:05Z,Definitely still getting the most out of my M1. Never felt any need to upgrade while using it for programming/development. The only thing that might convince me to upgrade is an OLED screen.
2025-02-22T08:06:43Z,My wife has an M1 going strong too. We will upgrade her at M5!
2025-02-21T23:37:52Z,"Is this sustained, what about thermals?"
2025-02-22T00:08:27Z,"The M1, M2, and M3 benchmarks are nearly identical too, until the Air thermal throttles. Given how hot my M4 MBP can get, it makes sense that the M4 Air will be nearly on par with the M4 MBP... until it thermal throttles."
2025-02-22T02:47:01Z,"Which is *kinda* fine, I think - at least for the short to medium term

The Air isn't meant to be the ""sustained workload"" machine, that's exactly what the Pro is for. The Air is meant to be a more general purpose machine

The M1, M2, M3 Air models still get decent performance once they throttle, and that initial peak is plenty to make them very snappy for most typical workloads they're likely to perform

BUT as /u/Smith6612 points out, a bursty workload today turns into a sustained workload in future and lack of cooling dramatically limits the longevity of a device. As workloads increase over time, that ""peak before throttling"" gets shorter and shorter, and the ability to be ""fine"" with 30-50% reduced performance vanishes

The M3 Air was *noticeably* worse than the M2 Air for throttling, too - so it'll be interesting to see how the M4 benchmarks look"
2025-02-22T02:52:30Z,"Yeah. Apple has been keeping their gains year over year by increasing clock speeds, and it's not sustainable. My m4 mbp gets noticeably worse battery life than my M1 mbp did under load. Hopefully they don't fall into the same trap intel did, where innovation gets replaced with ghz and power."
2025-02-22T03:01:52Z,"It's a tale as old as time - a company comes up with a new architecture that gives big efficiency gains, and everything is great

Then over time they need to continue improving performance and just up the clock speeds and power. As you say, exactly as Intel has done half a dozen times

The difference being that Intel doesn't need to care as much because they haven't formed their entire business around ""It's thin and light with a very long battery life"", whereas Apple is intrinsically linked to power consumption and portability. It's literally the main reason they created powerPC/IAM, the reason they left powerPC for Intel, and the reason they moved on from Intel to Apple Silicon

For me it comes down to ""I'd just get a Pro"", but I think Apple will hit a point before long where people start avoiding the Air because it proves not to have great longevity. Some will upgrade, of course, but some will go with other manufacturers entirely

I suspect by the M5 Air we'll probably find they add a cooling fan, maybe ditching it again for the M6 with the 2nm process improving thermals for a couple of generations"
2025-02-22T09:16:23Z,"I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll add a cooling fan to any of the Air‚Äôs. The fact is that for most people, the most intensive thing their computer will EVER do is run a benchmark. :) They don‚Äôt even run the kind of apps that would be able to generate a multithreaded ‚Äúsustained workload‚Äù across all cores. Most of what they do won‚Äôt even get the Air warm enough to keep it from being cold when using it on their lap."
2025-02-22T14:28:44Z,"yea and Im not really sure what people could be doing to need it.   My M1 handles 4k editing fine.  Lightroom runs good.  The use cases that needs more power everyday are not common and of course those users know that and would get a pro model or desktop. 

One of the most annoying things in the tech community is people who think every machine has to, or is even designed to, do everything possible.   The M series Airs are phenomenal laptops and are perfect for 90% of the population."
2025-02-22T10:15:04Z,"As far as I know, Apple aren‚Äôt involved in the development process, but static cooling fans are making some headway.

Especially for an Air, I could see that being the route in the next few years, unless there‚Äôs some major chip efficiency innovation."
2025-02-22T03:34:09Z,"This might sound like a stupid question but I'm curious, and you write well.

What is the threshold for what is considered ""sustained"" workload? An hour? All day? Something in between? Like I know one component of the measure is that it's high CPU/GPU usage, but for how long?

I'm curious at least as someone who sometimes needs *some* power for heavier photoshop and indesign files (I'm talking like multi-gig PSB files, etc.), but I'm not the kind of person who's rendering out 4K video overnight or bitcoin mining 24/7 or anything like that."
2025-02-22T13:03:47Z,"Sustained workloads are generally ones where you click a button and then wait a while for the computer to do the thing. Rendering video would be a classic example.

The alternative is so-called burst workloads, where the user throws a task at the computer that is intensive, but only for a very short period of time, and afterwards, the computer can go back to doing nothing and cooling down. Some examples would be opening a complex application or even opening a webpage. Generally, anything where you click a button and then the computer is done with what you asked it to do within a few seconds is considered a burst workload.¬†Burst workloads are generally far more common.

The MacBook Air can slow down during sustained loads that take more than 5-10 minutes. As a general rule of thumb, if you have a task where you make the computer do something, and then have to wait for the computer to finish for long enough that you know you can go prepare lunch or whatever before it‚Äôs done, that‚Äôs going to be faster on a MacBook Pro than a MacBook Air, even if both have the same chip.

Realistically, those types of workloads are often the ones that benefit the most from upgrading to a Pro or Max chip, so the comparison between the MacBook Air and the MacBook Pro with the base chip is somewhat silly. If this is a thing you regularly do, the M4 Pro MacBook Pro is so close in price to the M4 MacBook Pro that the upgrade is a no-brainer if you actually use the power, and if this is something you basically never do, but it happens one time, the fact that the MacBook Air will be slightly slower that time is basically irrelevant in the grand scheme of things."
2025-02-22T08:14:13Z,M4 runs hot. The m4 pro in my Mac mini crosses 100c in seconds after being loaded.
2025-02-22T10:09:11Z,"The Air is probably all I really need in terms of power, even the M1 is still strong, but I just feel so guilty when it starts to really warm up and throttle that I end up with a Pro again eventually. I do love the look of the Air tho, amazingly mobile sleek design."
2025-02-22T00:22:38Z,"Geekbench is a short test and doesn‚Äôt tell you much, it‚Äôs going to be the same drop in performance as an m3."
2025-02-22T02:32:36Z,"Not if it has heat pipe tech, supposedly the new iPhones will as well."
2025-02-22T02:37:57Z,"This is the magic question, and something review sites don't like to talk about.

Performance needs to be recorded in bursty workloads, and sustained workloads. That sort of testing will show how well the machine will age long term. Bursty workloads eventually turn into sustained workloads as software continues to grow more complex.

I still believe the MacBook Air needs some sort of cooling. Just for the sake of longevity."
2025-02-22T02:51:17Z,I wonder if the Air will eventually use some sort of vapor chamber
2025-02-22T02:53:17Z,Something like that combined with those motor-less coolers I keep seeing all over CES and Computex would be amazing. I know LTT has played around with those a bit.
2025-02-22T06:49:09Z,"I swear this has been a recurrent headline for all previous generation M-series MacBook Airs, and ultimately we know that it's not near Pro-series performance because these are always thermally limited; they don't have fans. 

It's just so funny to me that we keep seeing people make the same discovery over and over again."
2025-02-22T10:05:26Z,"I was thinking the same. The main difference between one Apple Silicon system and another (predicted before and has been true with every iteration since) has always been those physical features which sets one line apart from another. And, it makes sense. It benefits Apple to have a smaller selection of options. They don‚Äôt *need* a solution that performs many times worse than the high end in single threaded operations for their low end systems, so they don‚Äôt make one.

The fact that the Air performs as well as a Pro for most people (mainly because most people never experience thermal throttling because they don‚Äôt run workloads that stress the system in that way) really should be expected by now."
2025-02-22T03:11:06Z,"For sustained performance, wonder how long it‚Äôll be before someone makes a big metal plate for the Air to sit on to conduct built-up heat. Perhaps the plate could be vapor or liquid cooled."
2025-02-22T03:20:12Z,Why wouldn't you just bother with getting a MacBook Pro at that point?
2025-02-22T03:38:27Z,"Some people don't need high performance all the time, every day, but they do regularly want portability.

I'm not entirely sure what my next laptop will be, MBP or MBA, but I *sometimes* need heavier power but not *often*. When I travel for work I don't need power, I need portability. When I'm stationed locally, not always, but sometimes, I need power. I don't want to own two laptops. Having like, a ""heat sink"" pad for my desk is kind of appealing? Maybe?"
2025-02-22T11:15:44Z,"&gt;but they do regularly want portability

And the 14"" MacBook Pro is not portable, somehow?"
2025-02-22T11:28:15Z,"I moved to an Air M2 in 2022 after using a MBP since 2010.

I recently picked up my MBP to get some old files and dang did that thing feel like it weighs a ton after getting used to my Air.

In fact, when I first got my air I‚Äôd constantly check that it was in my backpack because it was so light I could not tell if I‚Äôd forgot to put it in before leaving the house."
2025-02-22T14:19:03Z,"It is super portable considering the power and additional features it offers, but the Air really is something else. I can hardly believe it‚Äôs a fully functional and actually quite powerful laptop whenever I pick one up."
2025-02-22T14:32:41Z,for as Apple as Apple is....thank god most consumers arent the ones making design decisions on products.   I hear some really dumb stuff around here.
2025-02-22T09:43:44Z,"I know someone that just wants to do some heavy lifting once or twice a month (video editing) and the rest of the time is fine with the performance weight of the MacBook Air over a Pro. They just sit their Air on an ice pack for those hours they want to get more performance, and it works well for them.

I don‚Äôt know if folks like that are a market large enough for anyone to develop any more tech than just that. :)"
2025-02-22T16:47:48Z,"same, but I just have a little fan blowing on the underside of the air for those occasional heavy workloads"
2025-02-22T16:50:28Z,"Yeah, the solution for the problem is exceedingly low-tech. While I‚Äôm sure some would jump at the opportunity to spend quite a lot of dollars on the solution, I don‚Äôt think there would be enough for someone to market and try to profit from selling such a device."
2025-02-23T03:51:47Z,I‚Äôve seen videos of people basically doing this but adding a pad to transfer heat from the chip to the baseplate of the machine. It did make it dangerously hot to put on your lap though.
2025-02-21T23:36:45Z,"Interesting. 

Would love to see what the M5s will bring to the table."
2025-02-22T00:16:34Z,"the bigger jump will be M6 when it switches to 2nm, as M5 is still planned to be manufactured using the 3nm process, though much improved. also, the next macbook design overhaul is supposedly in mid-late 2026, which lines up with the M6 release, it‚Äôll be an interesting year"
2025-02-22T03:31:10Z,Y'all keep saying this but the first consumer 3nm chips (M3 and A17 Pro) were a huge disappointment in terms of YoY improvements... A18/M4 had significant architectural changes which is why they are so much better. It's not just about the shrink in node size.
2025-02-22T12:48:13Z,They were based on a problematic manufacturing process that was TSMC‚Äôs issue more than anyone.
2025-02-22T18:15:34Z,The problems with the node were mostly yield and cost ‚Äì performance was similar and density was actually higher.
2025-02-22T02:48:46Z,"With rumours that the 2026 will be OLED, too, which would be a significant improvement"
2025-02-22T01:44:22Z,Yawn. I‚Äôll wait for 1nm.
2025-02-22T01:54:43Z,"M5-M6 is only one extra year, and redesign is expected the same year with M6, which can make the 1yr wait worth it for many people. 

the context is M5. 1nm is still many more years away, so for those who want an M5 it‚Äôs not really an option."
2025-02-22T05:31:45Z,Yeah but imagine the M7 chip‚Ä¶ /s
2025-02-22T06:58:41Z,Impressive. Very nice. Let's see M6.
2025-02-22T02:47:57Z,Just hope there is an option to add more than 24gb ram
2025-02-22T03:18:49Z,1 Billion dollars
2025-02-22T05:15:57Z,It‚Äôll support 32GB like the M4 Mac Mini
2025-02-22T05:20:01Z,If it doesn‚Äôt. I‚Äôll let you know that I‚Äôm gonna find you. I have a certain set of skills
2025-02-22T14:28:05Z,I feel pretty safe knowing Apple will never pass up an opportunity to sell 16GB of RAM for $400.
2025-02-22T22:55:09Z,It‚Äôs only a deal if I pay $500
2025-02-21T23:42:18Z,"Lmfao the duality. Notebookcheck said it didn‚Äôt live up to the performance. Tom‚Äôs Guide says it does.¬†

Tom‚Äôs Guide is correct. And I‚Äôm glad that the headline is actually accurate.¬†

@below

Lmfao this dude literally blocked me"
2025-02-22T10:16:42Z,"How much ram does it have? Because untill there's a meaningful upgrade that doesn't skin you alive, my M1 is perfectly fine compared to everything else that Apple offers in that performance segment."
2025-02-21T23:43:22Z,Let‚Äôs just hope the price won‚Äôt go up.
2025-02-21T23:53:58Z,I think that mostly depends on what happens with tariffs.
2025-02-22T14:20:05Z,Put OLEDs on both size Airs and they would be the perfect laptop
2025-02-22T09:56:52Z,"I think MacBook airs will definitely benefit from the ionic air coolers.

Passive cooling in a laptop just isn‚Äôt the best for performance heavy tasks

Or people should really just get a pro"
2025-02-22T21:35:01Z,People aren‚Äôt buying the Air for performance heavy tasks.
2025-02-22T16:39:57Z,My M1 Air with 16gig of ram still runs like a dream.
2025-02-22T17:25:14Z,"I have a 15"" M2 MBA, I'd only upgrade if I can get the nano texture antireflective display that's offered on the MBP"
2025-02-23T07:24:41Z,"I have the same computer, it's great!"
2025-02-22T00:29:21Z,No surprise. M4 exists in the MacBook Pro base model too.
2025-02-22T03:37:57Z,Unless it‚Äôs sustained performance then what does it matter?
2025-02-22T04:53:23Z,I'm considering getting a MBA for coding Rust. Compiling is a bursty workload. In-between compilation it would be mostly idle.
2025-02-22T11:18:03Z,Just what people need for Facebook and email...
2025-02-22T17:05:40Z,M1 air user here. Is air still 60Hz even in m4 ?
2025-02-22T17:33:18Z,"my m1 still chugging along, might consider upgrading if it gets an oled screen or the like."
2025-02-22T18:31:19Z,Doesn‚Äôt the entry-level MBP use the same chip?
2025-02-23T03:00:15Z,The only reason the pro sells is because thermal throttling kicks tf in and there won't be any config options. Like what were people expecting them to artificially throttle the chip and keep the same name
2025-02-23T03:47:31Z,*cries in M3*
2025-02-23T12:23:09Z,Wonder when they will update the screen on the air to a higher brightness and high refresh rate. Would get it over the pro any day then.
2025-02-22T06:42:19Z,13 inch air without fan and promotion/120hz is my dream laptop but wont happen. Have to stick to the pro :/ cannot look at 60hz screens anymore
2025-02-22T21:41:12Z,So I guess we‚Äôre all hoping the air can get better thermals to keep up with this performance eh?
2025-02-23T01:34:39Z,"My M2 Air has not been pushed. I use OBS + Elgato to my Xbox, but I watch the thermals with ‚ÄúHeat‚Äù app. Mac holds minimal temps"
2025-02-23T07:25:19Z,"Somehow, the 15 air has better thermals than the 13', just that bit much more space...."
2025-02-23T01:59:51Z,"My MBP hit 189,704 in Metal in Geekbench 6. I have to believe the Pro hits harder than claimed."
2025-02-23T04:26:58Z,still stuck with a shitty IPS panel though. literally the only reason i have a macbook pro over an air.
2025-02-23T08:09:59Z,"My M1 MBP still does everything I bought it for just fine.

Understand how Apple works their market share but sometimes you just gotta rein yourself in and stop Jonesing your wallet away for stuff that's just that bit better... for another coupla grand."
2025-02-23T09:01:23Z,"I‚Äôm rocking the M1 plus Odyssey 27inch monitor, graphic design and video editing still smooth af. In hindsight,  I wish I had upgraded the ram and ssd but, with unified memory keeping half the ssd freed lets the OS use it as RAM.

Not better than an actual memory upgrade, but I‚Äôll be rocking this for the next 10 years (My laptop before this was MBP 2015)."
2025-02-24T02:04:00Z,I was gifted an old 2009 iMac and the owner did not know their password to get into it. Does anybody know how I can completely reset the computer?
2025-02-24T15:43:04Z,"It depends. How important is the data on the computer?

Because if you don‚Äôt care about the data on the computer, and they didn‚Äôt put a password on the boot loader (which is not common), you could boot it into recovery mode, erase and re-create the main partition, and then reinstall the OS."
2025-02-23T22:09:40Z,"Hi guys.  I have a Family Sharing question.  I have Apple TV+, and I realized that my mom and dad were also paying for their own.  I thought maybe I could loop them into me, so I sent them both an invite to Family Sharing, which they accepted.

They seem to have no indication in Apple TV+ about this.  My dad tries signing in with his Apple ID and gets a page asking him to start a free trial.  Something is not connecting.  I thought once connected via family, they sign in with THEIR Apple ID, not mine, correct?

My mom‚Äôs also doesn‚Äôt work.  But that may be because the original profile they were paying for is under her Apple ID.  I‚Äôm not sure how it would work seeing as she has not yet canceled her plan, but also should have the new one under me.  Luckily, she didn‚Äôt cancel her old one, so they still have that.  But I wonder if it would help to cancel?

Also I am wondering if it is an issue that I live in Canada and they live still in the US.  I guess I should have led with that, if that ends up being the problem.

Anyway, any help would be great.  I kept them in the ‚ÄúFamily‚Äù for now.  But if this TV+ thing doesn‚Äôt work, I think I‚Äôll just end it.  Thanks!"
2025-02-24T04:24:56Z,Are you sure your Apple TV is being shared with the family?
2025-02-24T16:03:17Z,It says it is and is listed as a Shared Subscription.

(I looked for the PINNED POSTS to no avail)

I think if I could get through to someone at Apple, I might be able to solve this ...but.? My wife is the Apple person. She's had an iPhone6??? 11 years old or older. Amazingly it still works..or did until I went to Comcast. Since the newest Apple phone is coming out next week, we talked about buying one. But, (long explanation skipped) in the interim, I wanted her to TRY an extra Android phone we already owned. Comcast was supposed to simply switch the sim cards...but...after they finished that, the IP6 doesn't work anymore. Actually, it does work, but ""they don't support it anymore"". The phone actually does work, but won't connect to the WiFi or any phone lines. Wheeew.

To make things worse, when I try to get into her Apple photo account, Apple says That phone is no longer valid. I can get partially in, by using the ""extra"" phone number that was on the Android, but, then, Apple doesn't like the (proper) email address that my wife has always used in the past. So, I can't get into Apple to change the erroneous phone number, or anything else. To my surprise,m y wife's IPad still seems to work fine. Any ideas how I can get to someone at Apple who can help straighten this mess out?"

The phone not being able to connect is interesting .. The iPad working fine sounds completely normal. I‚Äôm guessing when you disabled the phone, a bunch of legacy connections were turned off on your account and normal security was finally enabled. 

Photo account? You mean iCloud Photo Library? All those photos can be accessed by any other reasonably modern Apple device. If she had photos sync turned on then they are just sitting there waiting for her. 

Not being able to connect to Wi-Fi. Not being able to use your email address. This sounds like several problems at the same time. Reset network settings for the first one to work again. I‚Äôm not sure what to do about the login issue, you didn‚Äôt include enough information.

 If she has a proper iPhone back up in iCloud or on a computer, then she is perfectly able to restore it onto a newer device."
2025-02-24T17:51:52Z,"It is the login issue that mostly concerns me.  Right now, the IPad is still working fine, but, if it loses that connection, then we don't seem to have any way to get back onto the Apple sign-in list??  The fact that the ""wrong"" phone number is what is recognized?...and then, the formerly proper email address is not recognized ...leaves us with no where to go.  I just attempted to arrange a meeting at a local Apple Store for help.  I have to ...  Sign In...to do so, and it doesn't recognize the account anymore.  Yikes!"
2025-02-24T04:30:46Z,"Your iPhone is outdated for a very very very long time. Your iPhone will ‚Äúwork‚Äù on WiFi but won‚Äôt with any company. They discontinued because I think the chips are too old to connect. 

First focus on a phone. Android or iPhone? iPhone makes it much easier to transfer from one device to the next. Android is much harder. Especially since the device is extremely outdated software wise. 

If iMessage is set up then you won‚Äôt get text messages to the android phone until you remove immesage. That requires you to log in with the Apple ID and remove it. 

I stay with the iPhone since she already has an iPad and they talk to each other. Android. Not really."
2025-02-24T20:31:53Z,"Thanks...we are still debating whether to get the new I-phone (out next week) or not.  Other than Apple Photos, I have everything moved over to the extra Android now. She is giving it a trial. So far, she is OK with it.   As I said above, my biggest worry is our inability to get into an operating Apple account. I am going to just drop by my nearest Apple Store and see if they can help.  Thanks again for your concern and help."
2025-02-23T20:43:43Z,"I've tried to migrate purchases on my iPhone and also on my iPad, but there's no ""Migrate Purchases"" option on View Account. Anyone else who hasn't seen it, have you been able to get it to appear?

I think I've followed all the instructions on [https://support.apple.com/en-us/117294#before-you-migrate](https://support.apple.com/en-us/117294#before-you-migrate) :

* Each device is running 18.3.1 (latest version).
* I'm logged in with my 'primary account', and my purchases are set to use a different 'secondary account'.
* Both accounts have 2FA enabled.
* I've removed myself from Family Sharing.
* Both accounts use the same country and region. (US)
* I have no rentals or pre-orders.
* It's been almost a month since my last purchase.

If the ""Migrate Purchases"" item doesn't even show up, is there any way to find out why?"
2025-02-23T20:41:27Z,"I just bought a new iPhone 16 and paid the small fee to have it rush delivered to my house within a time window. When I got the white Apple bag. The sticker that seals it closed to indicate it was opened wasn‚Äôt properly on. So the bag itself was open with the iPhone box and phone case box inside.

When I took the iPhone box out. It was still sealed. But the phone case box was opened. The case was still inside though.

Could the driver had used any of the info on the bottom of the iPhone box for anything nefarious? Or perhaps even opened the iPhone box and resealed it? Maybe I‚Äôm over thinking this."
2025-02-24T17:44:03Z,Make sure the data in ‚Äúsettings &gt; general &gt; about‚Äù matches what is on the phone box.. IMEI and otherwise.
2025-02-24T04:32:28Z,If the plastic/paper seal was on the actual iPhone then I wouldn‚Äôt worry about it.
2025-02-21T18:32:42Z,"TLDR: Apple News+ subscribers will soon have access to a new section called Apple News+ Food, featuring recipes, restaurant reviews, and kitchen tips from top food publishers. The new feature, available in April with iOS 18.4 and iPadOS 18.4, includes a Recipe Catalog with daily updates and a cook mode for full-screen instructions."
2025-02-21T18:40:39Z,"A great summary, and I highly recommend clicking on the Apple article.

They did a really great job with the UI. I hate how bad websites have become in clutter, and the Recipe Page looks so well designed and clear. Like a cookbook rather than a site.¬†"
2025-02-21T18:42:36Z,"100% agree. Personally, I use Mela for my cooking app and Apple‚Äôs implementation has the same look to it. 

If you could import recipes into Apple News and use it, this would be a game changer for me (and I do believe this will be coming later on)."
2025-02-21T19:23:26Z,I want them to separate it out to a standalone recipe app tbh
2025-02-22T23:38:41Z,If you like it so much why don't you invite it to prom
2025-02-21T19:45:21Z,This had better have the option to use weights for recipes rather than useless volumetric measurements. What the fuck is a cup of chopped broccoli?
2025-02-21T23:04:00Z,I‚Äôll grab my ankles while I wait for Apple One subscription to go up.
2025-02-21T18:38:25Z,Do the recipes in there also contains 10 pages of backstory and rambling about growing up in Minnesota before they finally get to the actual recipe?

2025-02-21T22:53:40Z,"Ironically enough, that looks like an NYT Cooking screenshot and that app lets you skip any story and get right to the recipe"
2025-02-22T01:56:35Z,NGL the NYT cooking app is great. Though I feel like they cull old recipes in favor of new ones. I tried a roasted garlic mashed potatoe receipe they had 10yrs ago and went through a phase where I made it all the time‚Ä¶. Wanted to make it again but couldn‚Äôt find it anywhere.
2025-02-22T03:51:06Z,Try looking for it using way back machine or the internet archives
2025-02-22T01:56:52Z,"The irony of this image is it's of an NYT recipe, and the only 2-3 sentence flavor text is the only non-recipe text on the page, and is often actually useful for the cook.  In comparison to the tomes on every other recipe website/food blog."
2025-02-22T05:30:43Z,Yeah lol this recipe isn‚Äôt bad actually.  It‚Äôs just the first sentence that is a trip
2025-02-22T06:56:57Z,"For the first time this week, I could truly laugh. Thank you. I mean it."
2025-02-21T18:39:27Z,"Great question. Because if they don't, I'm not interested."
2025-02-21T19:36:23Z,That extra spice from the author‚Äôs childhood trauma.
2025-02-21T21:02:24Z,Jenni‚Äôs ice-cream descriptions on their website is wild. I love reading poetic stories about Jenni‚Äôs childhood foreign exchange student friend who introduced her to dragon fruit or whatever dumb shit.
2025-02-21T21:16:24Z,is that what kids call it today?
2025-02-21T18:54:15Z,"The upshot of using paid services for recipes like New York Times (which I swear by) and cookbooks is that you don‚Äôt really run into this problem.

The LONG stories are filler to get more SEO for free blogs to actually appear on Google. Trust me. We don‚Äôt really want to write those either."
2025-02-21T19:06:17Z,More places for ads to appear also.
2025-02-21T19:15:49Z,Exactly
2025-02-22T01:49:28Z,So much engagement!
2025-02-21T22:13:45Z,"&gt;	We don‚Äôt really want to write those either.

Thanks to ChatGPT, you no longer have to!"
2025-02-22T01:57:29Z,I feel like most of the Google found recipe sites have a skip to recipe button.
2025-02-21T19:39:22Z,"Grab the app Mela! Beautiful app, one time purchase, and you can send any recipe from the share sheet to it and it‚Äôll cut out all the bullshit"
2025-02-21T21:11:10Z,I have a docker container that lets me point it at a web page and it'll do its best to parse a recipe out of it. Works pretty well
2025-02-21T22:01:54Z,What's the name?
2025-02-21T22:29:19Z,I use Mealie for this
2025-02-21T21:55:38Z,Recipe Keeper is a free alternative
2025-02-21T18:44:11Z,"Can‚Äôt just copyright a recipe. So you gotta do something else to differentiate yourself from all the other instances of the exact same recipe out there. 

Also ads. But originally that first thing for sure."
2025-02-21T19:19:20Z,"Nothing to do with copyright, the long blog posts are for SEO purposes."
2025-02-21T19:28:59Z,How does it help?
2025-02-21T19:56:04Z,"Many different ways: 

- Google prioritizes ‚Äúunique‚Äù content, so while every recipe for chicken noodle soup or whatever will be pretty similar, the story before it is unique and that‚Äôs a plus in google‚Äôs eyes 

- Repeating keywords is a factor in ranking. If you want to rank highly for ‚Äúbest chicken soup‚Äù you‚Äôre going to want to repeat that phrase a few times. You can make it seem natural in a long blog post. 

- Speaking of which, length in general is a factor as well. A page with four lines of ingredients and instructions is going to seem bare to Google‚Äôs algorithm, and therefore less useful, which ranks it lower. 

- While many skip the story and go straight to the recipe, some will read it, which improves metrics such as time spent on page. And of course, ad views. 

- There are probably more that I‚Äôm not thinking of right now. SEO is a complicated game with sometimes perverse incentives."
2025-02-21T19:20:35Z,Yeah 100% of the blame for this rests with Google and nobody else.
2025-02-21T18:59:19Z,Add ‚Äúcooked.wiki/‚Äú before the url of a recipe and it cuts all that bullshit out. It‚Äôs incredible!
2025-02-21T21:29:22Z,&gt; üö´ The owner of this site has requested to be excluded from Cooked.
2025-02-21T19:11:04Z,"From the screenshots in the article it looks like no. Since it‚Äôs a paid feature they don‚Äôt need to fluff up the page with text and ads. 
Looks like a quick tab between recipe/ingredients and step by step directions. 

Honestly looking forward to this feature, as long as there are tons of recipes. If it can somehow integrate with grocery lists feature the Apple reminders app I would be very happy."
2025-02-21T20:26:17Z,"https://youtube.com/watch?v=ZvC2jtmVAMs

Here's a good link about those backstories and why they're a thing"

https://youtu.be/ZvC2jtmVAMs?si=2KN9a2831wIa43Lt"
2025-02-22T00:01:16Z,I just checked on the beta and no backstory or crap. Just a quick description of the recipe and then the ingredients and instructions.
2025-02-21T18:37:31Z,"Did *anyone* have rumors about this? This really came out of nowhere. I know it's easy to keep software updates a secret compared to hardware, but still usually *something* leaks out."
2025-02-21T18:38:45Z,"I know Gurman said this morning the beta would be coming today, but as far as I know, NOTHING about this was even hinted about. 

This is super cool though, and the full screen lyrics style food directions looks awesome."
2025-02-21T19:03:18Z,"It does look really nice. 

I want so badly to like Apple News, it‚Äôs just such a terrible news app. I‚Äôve spent so many nights configuring my tastes and I still get bombarded with ads as a subscriber and stuff I don‚Äôt care about (even after turning today view into something that should only show what I care about). I‚Äôm hoping the news app gets some love, and while recipes are nice, it‚Äôs not at all what I want from this app."
2025-02-21T19:09:07Z,"I totally agree with you. I too have tried to customize it into something that would only show me top headlines, Apple News, and sports news. 

Unfortunately, it shows me pages of top headlines from sources I don‚Äôt want to read, sensationalist garbage in the middle, and then Apple/Sports stuff (with sources that I also have tried to block).  

It‚Äôs so frustrating because it could be so good, and yet it just isn‚Äôt."
2025-02-21T19:12:35Z,"Exactly! Even the notifications are infuriating. I want breaking news but 90% of the notifications are story pieces on random people. 

All of that said, the magazines are fantastic so I have to give credit where it‚Äôs due. I just wish we could actually use Apple News for.. news! I‚Äôm hoping it gets the updates it deserves over time. Even the safari ai summary would be nice to have within the news app."
2025-02-21T18:38:32Z,I‚Äôm glad it was kept secret. I hate everything leaking
2025-02-21T18:39:57Z,"I was little confused why it as under News+, but it kind of makes sense. This is definitely tempting me further to subscribe. If they can just connect with my local news outlets as well that would sink it for me. They seem to have every other region of my state covered."
2025-02-21T19:34:38Z,likely to compete with NYT Cooking app/section which is behind their subscription as well
2025-02-21T21:16:57Z,NYT Cooking is likely being pursued as an addition. The New York Times offers access to both The Athletic and wire cutter today as accessible through Apple News.
2025-02-21T19:20:14Z,Maybe the influx of users because of the recipes feature will give Apple some motivation to improve the actual news portion of the app.
2025-02-21T19:11:37Z,This feels like setting up for the HomePod with a screen
2025-02-21T22:33:16Z,Around my house I call that an iPad
2025-02-22T04:02:20Z,Bingo
2025-02-21T18:37:23Z,This honestly sounds great and will get me using News+ more
2025-02-21T19:16:36Z,Are you using it already? Just curious what people's experiences are like and if it's worth it
2025-02-21T22:30:39Z,I use it every day to catch up with the news.
2025-02-21T19:29:36Z,"I use it to find news on topics I like, like Lord of the Rings and Green Lantern. Outside of that I play some of the Quartiles puzzles they put out daily."
2025-02-23T11:03:12Z,The value is amazing is you are on a family sharing plan. The fact it contains WSJ and some of my most read magazines is great for the value and my wife loves that it has vanity fair and one or two magazines she loves as well
2025-02-21T18:39:08Z,Only slightly more convenient than using an app such as [Pestle.](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1574776971)
2025-02-21T18:43:08Z,"I‚Äôve been using Pestle since release and I‚Äôve loved it.
Excited to try this News+ Food."
2025-02-21T18:44:48Z,"Same. I don‚Äôt have News+ but if a new trial period rolls around, I‚Äôll give it a shot. Pestle is just such a great app that functions exactly as I need it."
2025-02-21T18:58:34Z,or Paprika!
2025-02-22T11:56:25Z,Can anyone say what advantages Pestle might have over Paprika? Is it still $20 for a lifetime subscription to Pestle?
2025-02-21T19:28:49Z,"Meanwhile, Apple News+ still isn‚Äôt available in my country. Or most countries. As if none of the rest of us would want it."
2025-02-21T20:38:07Z,I genuinely find this perplexing. I‚Äôm in Ireland and we usually get most Apple services but this one is missing with no explanation
2025-02-21T23:47:01Z,"It‚Äôs so weird. If it‚Äôs a location-based subscription issue or something just let me get the basic functions of the app then, I just want the nifty news aggregator. Fitness+ and Apple Sports aren‚Äôt available either and I don‚Äôt get what at all. I know the damn language that the instructors speak and I follow the sports available in that app. Why the hell am I not allowed to have either?"
2025-02-22T11:15:45Z,"Its infuriating. News+ is genuinely a good deal in a sea of paywalls across the internet for news and culture.

I mostly wanna read international websites and magazines anyway, maybe 3-4 local sources but I‚Äôll add those myself.

I‚Äôd be happy with an edition for Europe, or at the very least an international edition for anyone outside the 4 countries they bother to support."
2025-02-22T13:19:50Z,yea.. this and Fitness+
2025-02-21T18:39:18Z,This is pretty neat.
2025-02-21T19:13:16Z,Can‚Äôt wait to use it on the new HomePod with screen in the kitchen
2025-02-21T19:14:31Z,"Damn, I love this."
2025-02-21T19:12:45Z,"I like it! It would be even better if they built a proper calorie and macro tracking app that lets you quickly log these recipes. I know you can already log things with the Health app, but it feels clunky."
2025-02-21T19:17:24Z,Very excited to check this out on the iPad üòç
2025-02-22T05:10:20Z,"Why is this bundled with News and not Health, or a standalone app altogether?"
2025-02-21T18:47:41Z,"The News app itself is poorly designed.

I cancelled my News+ subscription because of the obnoxious ads for hearing aids and weight loss pills that they put in the middle of every article. 

News+ has a decent selection of magazines, but I can get all those same magazines for free using my public library card and the Libby app."
2025-02-21T20:36:40Z,Good first attempt. Would love to see Apple Intelligence throw together an estimated calorie and macro breakdown for each of these.
2025-02-21T21:17:40Z,"Wow, what a week for Apple. Their pace of innovation is staggering, capped-off by the incredible ALL NEW News+ Food! This truly is the News+ for food pros!"
2025-02-22T15:59:26Z,This apparently will tie in to the HomePad product aiming for kitchens
2025-02-21T18:40:27Z,I wish they would add the feature to stop showing blocked channels in my feed.
2025-02-21T18:50:02Z,"Will be using this a lot I expect, but I‚Äôd rather the recipe catalogue be its own app rather than having to pull up the ‚ÄúNews‚Äù app for recipes.

I‚Äôm a daily user of Crouton and will be excited to check this out, I love finding new recipes."
2025-02-21T18:57:51Z,"This will be nice. I‚Äôve been using News+ since it came out and I bookmark things like Kitchn articles that have recipes and have wished that I could categorize them for a long time. As it is now, going back and finding them is a chore."
2025-02-21T19:27:41Z,Well if this lands the way it‚Äôs advertised I‚Äôm happy with the subscription
2025-02-21T19:47:58Z,"This sounds great. I‚Äôve been using the Mela app to extract and manage recipes from random websites. It‚Äôs really well designed, probably the most elegant recipe app, but content discovery is still a pain. This should help.

The random recipe websites are so, so, so bad and SEO optimized to crap. This is all because the ad funded business model of the web sucks these days. Even Apple News+ has bad ads interspersed, but it‚Äôs much better. The New York Times has a good recipe section / app but it was too expensive just for that.

I can imagine using News+ to find new recipes and leverage personalization. I‚Äôll probably still share my favorites to Mela so I can still organize recipes from all over the web, but we‚Äôll see how it goes.

2025-02-21T20:28:40Z,"Nice! I hope I can export them to Paprika, as that‚Äôs my go-to app for recipe storage."
2025-02-22T06:14:35Z,Apple has done such a terrible job of supporting News+ outside of the US that I expect this to be another geographically locked feature forever. No mention in the article so hoping to be proven wrong but I doubt it¬†
2025-02-22T10:11:48Z,"When will Apple release news app in all regions , it‚Äôs not available for me"

2025-02-22T12:51:41Z,This will be a welcome addition IMO. Especially if it‚Äôs better than most others you have to pay for
2025-02-22T15:43:55Z,"It looks like the recipe UI also has built-in links to timers, making it easy to just tap and launch the timer without needing to switch apps or invoke Siri. This could be really neat if it's fully integrated in the OS."
2025-02-21T19:32:09Z,Too expensive.
2025-02-21T18:45:53Z,"Cool, but it would be even better if included step by step video like Creme."
2025-02-21T19:08:09Z,Can we smell the food through our phones?
2025-02-21T19:17:08Z,Woah so this is the end result of those rumors a few years back that Apple was looking into nutrition and food services in some way. I find it weird this is a News+ subscription thing though and not part of the Health App‚Ä¶ I guess it‚Äôs tied to articles in Apple News but yeah I feel like this odd placement will result in it being more ignored than used.
2025-02-23T22:48:07Z,"Nice design, did you make those app preview screenshots yourself? Really well done"
2025-02-23T22:50:38Z,Thank you for the kind words! I collaborated with a mobile designer for the UI designs and the App Store assets.
2025-02-23T14:28:56Z,"Looks like Sign in with Apple has broken the app. Downloaded, continued with apple as a sign in option and the app freezes and eventually crashes. Upon reopening the app stalls on the splash screen and then eventually crashes."
2025-02-23T14:32:16Z,Really? I will take a look because I haven‚Äôt encountered this before. Can you try a reinstall?
2025-02-23T14:32:35Z,Already tried. Same issue.
2025-02-23T14:33:42Z,Ok thanks for reporting. I just tried with my account and it worked but I am going to take a look.
2025-02-24T06:28:10Z,"The UI is not my taste in general, but for this kind of app it fits perfectly. Well done. Also cool Appname/appicon"
2025-02-24T12:45:16Z,"Thank you for the nice words, really appreciate it!"
2025-02-21T15:10:55Z,So embarrassing. I am so annoyed with the recent UK governments being so anti tech. This is dangerous.
2025-02-21T15:54:12Z,"An important point is that it‚Äôs not clear that even this will be enough to comply with the law.

From the article:

&gt; It is not clear that Apple's actions will fully address those concerns, as the IPA order applies worldwide and ADP will continue to operate in other countries.

The law requires Apple to hand over encrypted data, for any user in the world, to the UK government. The law does not depend on whether the feature is enabled in the UK or not. Even with the feature switched off in the UK, the law requires Apple to hand over encrypted data from, for example, American users - something which they‚Äôre not currently able to do, and they‚Äôre very unlikely to ever build the capability to be able to do in the future. To comply with the UK law, they would either need to introduce a back door, or disable the feature worldwide. I can‚Äôt see them being happy to do either of these.

It‚Äôll be fascinating to see how this plays out."
2025-02-21T16:44:45Z,"&gt; The law requires Apple to hand over encrypted data, for any user in the world, to the UK government. 

It would be far less expensive for Apple to simply pull out of the UK market than to tell everyone in the world that they're handing our stuff to Starmer."
2025-02-21T17:11:40Z,"Doubt, only a small number of people even know about ADP. If they killed it globally, the outcry would be minimal. This is a case we should be glad Apple is even bothering to fight."
2025-02-21T17:32:28Z,"Yeah, but as someone in the UK, Apple should threaten to pull out of the UK. This is absolutely ridiculous.

I really thought the clown show was over after the election, but it‚Äôs apparently gonna be a running gag."
2025-02-21T19:17:41Z,"I don't think the US government would be too happy about Apple handing Americans' data to Starmer.

It's the 'any user in the world' part which is the real problem."
2025-02-22T09:04:03Z,US agencies would be happy if it meant UK agencies can spy on US citizens on their behalf and at their request.
2025-02-21T16:21:24Z,"I am proud of Apple for refusing to backdoor iCloud.¬†

Apple needs to threaten pulling out of these POS governments markets. I would completely support that even if I don‚Äôt get access to the latest Apple products if it ever happened to me.¬†

For the record, Apple did refuse to install a backdoor. From what I understand, this is reversal to the previous status quo of encrypted backups, but not end to end encrypted back ups.¬†

https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/02/07/apple-encryption-backdoor-uk/

&gt;‚Ä¶Apple remains committed to offering our users the highest level of security for their personal data and are hopeful that we will be able to do so in the future in the United Kingdom. As we have said many times before, we have never built a backdoor or master key to any of our products or services and we never will.‚Äù

-Apple, today (quoted from 9to5Mac)

https://9to5mac.com/2025/02/21/apple-removing-end-to-encryption-uk/

Ever since this EU crap with the App Store suddenly all governments around the world want to dictate exactly how your phone functions."
2025-02-21T20:14:10Z,"Agreed. The blowback would be huge to the government. Imagine no more iPhones for sale in UK, people flocking to their MPs to demand why they want all our data or no phones; this would be reversed in hours."
2025-02-21T16:56:32Z,"Apple did stand up to them. They‚Äôve been appealing this since it was announced ages ago. 

It‚Äôs not up to Apple. It‚Äôs the people who need to vote and hold their politicians accountable."
2025-02-21T17:53:32Z,"If Apple stands up further by moving out, then Brits will pressure the UK. I think that‚Äôs a better idea."
2025-02-21T22:54:28Z,yeah! apple should just threaten to leave the UK and they‚Äôll win because of public outrage
2025-02-21T17:01:24Z,"I agree completely

Apple did refuse the government‚Äôs request for a backdoor.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/02/07/apple-encryption-backdoor-uk/"
2025-02-21T18:09:30Z,The issue is that both political parties seem to listen to the Home Office too much
2025-02-21T18:33:50Z,"The problem is, the law requires that you still comply while you're appealing. This law is a terrible law."
2025-02-21T16:22:50Z,I'm guessing the private data will be shared among the Five Eyes intelligence agencies.
2025-02-21T17:00:35Z,One part of the law was that Apple wasn't supposed to disclose the order. I wonder if they violated the law by removing the feature instead of just installing a backdoor.
2025-02-21T18:03:37Z,"I doubt Apple would have played along either way, but I suspect they approached Apple but the UK government was miffed that they couldn‚Äôt break into accounts that already had ADP enabled. So the user would have been notified to change some stuff on iCloud, tipping everyone off."
2025-02-21T16:46:40Z,Yes but Apple is basically saying that's all you get. The next step presumably would be to pull out if they are genuinely going to stand by their words.
2025-02-21T17:20:23Z,"The only way for Apple to avoid being put under pressure to comply with the order, would be to no longer operate in the UK (i.e. close all Apple Stores, stop operating any legal entities and datacenters in the UK). They're not going to do that unless there was some extraordinary push back to them complying with the order.

They haven't complied with what was ordered, as they only are making changes to ADP, and only for UK users.  
The order is the ability to access all data stored in iCloud, for anyone worldwide.

So, even with this change to ADP, everyone inside the UK still has data that is inaccessible to Apple, even without ADP involved because some data categories are always end-to-end encrypted even if you don't toggle Advanced Data Protection on ([source]( https://support.apple.com/en-gb/102651)):

* Passwords and Keychain
* Health data
* Journal data
* Home data
* Messages in iCloud 
* Payment information
* Apple Card transactions
* Maps
* QuickType Keyboard learnt vocabulary
* Safari
* Screen Time
* Siri information
* Wi-Fi passwords
* W1 and H1 Bluetooth keys
* Memoji"
2025-02-21T17:17:22Z,"Interesting since if Apple did comply, they would likely be banned from other countries. If Apple has to choose between the UK and _every other market_, they will just drop the UK. Of course, they will likely negotiate / lobby hard to avoid that scenario."
2025-02-21T17:14:39Z,"My conspiracy theory is that the UK never expected Apple to comply (I mean, handing over a back door to global user data?) but rather it‚Äôs a coordinated effort to get rid of end to end encryption completely. My guess is that it‚Äôs not solely being led by the UK government, they‚Äôre just the ones to take point."
2025-02-21T18:01:37Z,"I think you‚Äôre bang on the money. Last September they conceded banning encryption in the online safety bill until a time ‚Äúwhen it is technically feasible‚Äù. They‚Äôre first going to force E2EE out, and then they‚Äôll go after TLS with government mandated CA."
2025-02-21T16:21:27Z,This is a nightmare for privacy. You know every country now is going to press for similar treatment.
2025-02-21T16:38:51Z,"Yep. In a world of ever increasing geopolitical instability and increased use of cyberattacks and other hybrid/grey zone warfare by hostile foreign states - including one currently waging a war of aggression on our continent - the UK Govt. has successfully made the data of every Apple user in the country, including many politicians, scientists, journalists, and so on, significantly more vulnerable. 

Cheers guys, great work. Nice one. 

Fucking idiots."
2025-02-21T16:06:45Z,They are horrible!
2025-02-21T19:20:41Z,My sentiments entirely
2025-02-21T15:13:55Z,This has the potential to open a huge can of worms
2025-02-21T15:45:48Z,"Yep this isn‚Äôt just bad for the UK, now lots of countries will start requesting it. Not just to Apple, but likely to other services that offer encryption."
2025-02-21T18:14:18Z,ADP was already geoblocked in a number of countries. I don‚Äôt believe it ever launched in any of them to begin with though. A country having access to ADP then later getting put on the banned list is the new part.
2025-02-21T16:42:20Z,"I don‚Äôt think it will. The UK will just be made an example of. 

Want XYZ service to open up its encryption? We‚Äôll just leave Britain. Signal said they‚Äôd do it and they ain‚Äôt fucking around. 

Other countries will quickly give up on it when they see what a shit show the UK made it."
2025-02-21T16:44:03Z,Why do we always have to be the demonstration of how not to do things? I‚Äôm sick of it!
2025-02-21T18:58:55Z,You got fish and chips right. That‚Äôs something.¬†
2025-02-21T21:38:57Z,"Encryption had its day as not all governments truly understood the implications of it in the hands of the populace so they will simply all regulate it to the point it will be allowed if not required for specific areas of commerce but governments will not let themselves to be denied access to communications passing through their domain.  
  
If anything other countries will see the example the UK has presented and tune their response appropriately if not cooperating with friendly governments to craft a single action; heck I would not be surprised if it isn't running through Brussels right now.  Just because it has been expressed that privacy is an important right there are commissions already formed looking to provide a legal means of access; remember CSAR; Child Sex Abuse Regulation; that was basically aiming to require non discriminate scanning of all transmissions for child abuse material.
    
They will try their best to find a way around the  EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and CSAR was such an attempt that even law enforcement was already suggesting be broadened.  Here is to hoping the courts keep up their diligence.   
  
Then comes the other angle, while rights may be protected at home there could be a day where it actually is dangerous to travel to other countries because of their demands against encryption."
2025-02-21T17:07:09Z,I have everything crossed that some activist hacker group specifically goes after UK politicians and in a month or two we are seeing their entire photos/messages etc online.
2025-02-21T16:04:50Z,That the UK government feels entitled to my data. Absolutely ridiculous.
2025-02-21T17:59:21Z,"Also how exactly does this stupid ‚Äúlaw‚Äù work?

The UK government can access the files of any Apple user ‚Äî anywhere in the whole goddamn world?

So, the UK government can legally access the files of foreign politicians, political leaders, scientists, journalists‚Ä¶ and find out exactly what they‚Äôre working on? That‚Äôs fucking insane to the point that it‚Äôs really not Apple‚Äôs fight at this point. Every government in the world should be coming together to sanction the shit out of the UK government for this gross overreach.

The UK government is effectively requesting unfettered access to the private data of POTUS, every member of congress, every scientist working on AI and whatnot in the United Stares and China. Wtf is this?

Any government that overreaches this way should be economically sanctioned and be treated just like Iran, Russia, or Syria ‚Äî until it sees the error of its ways.

Nothing like complete economic collapse to punish leftwing and rightwing authoritarian fascists."
2025-02-21T18:11:48Z,our government has historically justified any invasion of privacy under the time honoured justification of requiring you to please think of thhe children.
2025-02-21T16:38:21Z,"Write to your MP and object, ask them to seek comment from the Home office.  

Be polite, explain the importance of end-to-end encryption in the modern cyber security landscape and how this does nothing but reduce security for all UK users (including MPs who have iDevices).

2025-02-21T15:10:28Z,"iCloud settings on iPhone now states ""Apple can no longer offer Advanced Data Protection (ADP) in the United Kingdom to new users."", however it seems it in my case hasn't been disabled for users who have had it already enabled."
2025-02-21T15:15:42Z,"From the article. 

&gt; The ADP service started to be pulled for new users at 1500GMT on Friday. Existing users' access will be disabled at a later date."
2025-02-21T15:43:16Z,"I‚Äôm curious about how it is technically feasible for existing users to have the service disabled. Wasn‚Äôt the tech advertised as e2ee? How can Apple reverse without holding the private key?
Or will they just tell users that their data will be scrambled?"
2025-02-21T15:46:29Z,they could stop providing service until users manually turn it off.
2025-02-21T15:57:20Z,Or a whole new back up without the encryption on your next back up overnight
2025-02-21T16:07:40Z,"Probably. From what I learned, apple was required to store data of Chinese users in servers located in China then they stopped provided iCloud until users agreed to move data to China's servers. So I assume they would do same in UK."
2025-02-21T16:11:00Z,"I could see it happening in two phases.    
Phase 1 - Apple stops encrypting new data with private keys.    
Phase 2a - Apple tells users that data protected by private keys will be decrypted by the device when the data is accessed; or    
Phase 2b - Apple tells users that data protected by private keys will be deleted on a certain date unless they are decrypted; or    
Phase 2c - Apple implements a method to extract private keys from a device when the device is unlocked, then uses that to decrypt the data."
2025-02-21T16:16:08Z,"You aren‚Äôt really reversing it.

Imagine you have a car that comes with two car keys. When you buy the car (ADP), the dealer tells you they won‚Äôt be able to provide you with any new keys if you lose all of them. If you still have one key, you can copy it. 

Now your angry sister in law ‚Äúuk‚Äù wants to be able to borrow any car in the city demands a key be at her house, so you return both sets of keys to the dealer for a different set, plus the one."
2025-02-21T15:55:33Z,This was fast too. I checked at 1502 and it was already gone.
2025-02-21T15:44:25Z,"Wow, and China still has Advanced Data Protection (ADP)."
2025-02-21T16:38:26Z,Wow fuck the UK government overreach
2025-02-21T15:14:43Z,Yeah I hate this. It's something I turned on immediately as it was available.
2025-02-21T17:20:00Z,"Make sure to email your MP about this. You can find their email here: [https://members.parliament.uk/members/Commons](https://members.parliament.uk/members/Commons)

Here is what i sent:

&gt;I am writing to express my strong opposition to the Government‚Äôs plans to force Apple and other companies to weaken security on cloud storage services like iCloud. This is a serious threat to the privacy and security of millions of people, including your constituents.

&gt;The biggest issue with these proposals is that once a backdoor exists, it isn‚Äôt just the UK Government that can use it‚Äîanyone can. Cybercriminals, hackers, and hostile countries like Russia and China would be able to exploit these weaknesses, putting personal data, businesses, and even national security at risk. There is no such thing as a ‚Äúsafe‚Äù backdoor. History has shown that any intentional security vulnerability will eventually be found and abused by bad actors.

&gt;Apple has already responded to this by disabling its most secure cloud storage features in the UK, and they plan to remove them for existing users soon. This shows just how serious the risk is. If companies are forced to weaken encryption, many will either pull services from the UK or leave users exposed to attacks.

&gt;All this will achieve is pushing people like me to switch to services based outside the UK Government‚Äôs jurisdiction. If the Government forces UK-based services to introduce security weaknesses, people will simply move their data elsewhere to maintain their privacy and security. This will not make anyone safer‚Äîit will just encourage people to use alternatives that the Government has no oversight of.

&gt;Most people store huge amounts of personal data in the cloud‚Äîprivate photos, documents, passwords, financial information, and even medical records. Weakening encryption means none of this will be truly secure anymore. No one should have to choose between using essential technology and keeping their private data safe.

&gt;I urge you to oppose these dangerous proposals and stand up for the privacy and security of ordinary people. I would appreciate hearing your position on this issue and what steps you will take to ensure our data remains protected."
2025-02-21T15:22:38Z,Does anyone know if there is a way around this? Can we change our Apple Account regions to the US or France or something?
2025-02-21T17:38:47Z,"I'd say your best bet is to just take a round-trip ticket to France. People have managed to [circumvent iPhone geo-restrictions features](https://lagrangepoint.substack.com/p/airpods-hearing-aid-hacking), but let's just say the solution isn't practical for the average guy."
2025-02-21T15:27:38Z,Mines already set like that for some Apple Intelligence features and mines gone. It‚Äôs using GPS or mobile data to see that you‚Äôre in the UK
2025-02-21T17:36:55Z,"You could encrypt your stuff locally before backing it up. But that's extra steps.

But I learned on the last thread that in the UK you can be compelled and put in prison if you don't hand out the keys.

So at best you get protection in the sense that you _will_ know if they want to access your data or not."
2025-02-21T18:19:48Z,Claim you don‚Äôt remember the password
2025-02-21T18:30:08Z,"I'm not an expert nor even close, as I said, I got the info after one of the threads here about it.

But I'd bet you could go to prison the either way. I'm sure it doesn't matter if you don't know it, don't remember it or don't want to give it to them.

If that data would incriminate you for something that leads to a decade in prison, it's still a ""win"" though..."
2025-02-21T15:11:04Z,"WTF? 

Unless I‚Äôm missing something obvious, surely Apple doesn‚Äôt have the ability to disable E2E encryption on my account unless I give them my key? Are they just gonna shut accounts down that don‚Äôt give it over or something"
2025-02-21T15:13:35Z,"Yeah this is what I was wondering, I also have it enabled and so far it is still showing as so

EDIT - what they will probably do is either ask users turn it off by a certain date or they will erase any encrypted backups and ask you to back up again if you want to continue iCloud"
2025-02-21T16:18:57Z,"I thought I had it on, I didn‚Äôt, and now can‚Äôt enable it lol."
2025-02-21T15:28:12Z,"&gt; Apple doesn‚Äôt have the ability to disable E2E encryption on my account unless I give them my key?

According to Apple security guide:

&gt; The Advanced Data Protection and iCloud.com web access settings can be modified only
by the user. These values are stored in the user‚Äôs iCloud Keychain device metadata and can
only be changed from one of the user‚Äôs trusted devices. Apple servers can‚Äôt modify these
settings on behalf of the user, nor can they roll them back to a previous configuration.

So perhaps a software update will disable the encryption. Wondering if this will also apply to data still E2EE even when ADP is off.

&gt; Are they just gonna shut accounts down that don‚Äôt give it over or something

Looks like yes.

&gt; British customers who already have Advanced Data Protection will be warned later to disable it or lose access to iCloud."
2025-02-21T15:26:44Z,"Not sure how this will work, they can't decrypt your files. So it _may_ end up as a popup on your phone/ipad/mac that you can't get rid of until you disable the feature."
2025-02-21T17:11:20Z,"Nah. They'll just ask users to disable the feature, and if the feature is still enabled after a certain amount of time they will lose access to their iCloud data."
2025-02-21T16:54:45Z,Provide an API to iCloud please so we can add our own encryption
2025-02-21T15:52:24Z,"Very disappointing. With a precedent now set, I suspect this will spread as other countries make similar demands."
2025-02-21T16:24:44Z,"To be clear, this Apple notice is the one we know about.

Every other major service provider probably has one too (including Google and Meta/WhatsApp) and they have most likely just complied to create a secret back door."
2025-02-21T15:19:35Z,"Day after day, I hate this country more and more.

Not financially ready to leave just yet sadly."
2025-02-21T18:49:13Z,Where would you go?
2025-02-21T17:05:23Z,This sets a dangerous precedent‚Ä¶ I wish Apple stood up for themselves here and I hope they never allow something like this to happen in the U.S.
2025-02-21T15:32:09Z,FFS.
2025-02-21T15:50:00Z,What happened to democracy?
2025-02-21T17:09:26Z,There is no party in the uk that cares about your privacy they are all bad as each other
2025-02-21T16:03:17Z,"I said that it would be disabled worldwide, back when we were discussing repercussions. In a just world Apple would pull out of the UK, but we know that wasn‚Äôt going to happen lol. 

Very annoyed at the UK right now"
2025-02-21T16:50:32Z,"I am so ashamed of the UK government for this. Many other governments will soon follow suit.

I am interested why only Apple, though (at least for now)? My WhatsApp backups are end-to-end encrypted and, as far as I know, Meta doesn't have access to my private key and haven't been petitioned to disable the feature (yet).

Similarly, I use Proton Mail (and Proton Drive) - will they be next? Their whole business model revolves around end-to-end encryption. Their basis is that all of their data is stored in Switzerland and subject to Swiss privacy laws... but seemingly the UK government don't seem to care about that. Their line seems to be 'if the data belongs to a UK citizen, it must be obtainable by us'. So I wonder how Proton will respond?

I can only imagine Keir Starmer will shortly be publicly releasing his entire camera roll, message history and browsing history online for us all to view. Perfect way for him to demonstrate that if we have nothing to hide then we have nothing to fear."
2025-02-21T15:12:57Z,"Wow that‚Äôs a huge move 

I wonder if other authoritarian governments will now pressure Apple. 

I wonder if it‚Äôs a PR move from Apple to cast the UK government in a bad light. 

So much for ensuring users privacy"

&gt;So much for ensuring users privacy

Lmfao there it is. Blaming Apple instead of going after overreaching POS governments"
2025-02-21T15:22:55Z,I wouldn‚Äôt call it an Apple problem. It‚Äôs a UK government problem.
2025-02-21T15:17:35Z,Uk government does that all by itself.  Absolutely shambolic
2025-02-21T17:20:51Z,"Can we create another account that's based on another country (like US or any european country), and use the encrypted service even if living in the UK?"
2025-02-21T17:31:40Z,My ADP has turned itself off and it‚Äôs greyed out. I‚Äôm fucking fuming.
2025-02-21T15:14:26Z,UK government is pure evil
2025-02-21T15:39:01Z,[deleted]
2025-02-21T15:40:59Z,You can be mad at the Government because privacy is a human right
2025-02-21T18:14:06Z,if they can just arbitrarily turn it off at will how can they claim that it was ever actually encrypted without them having access in the first place?
2025-02-21T18:18:39Z,Being from the UK I‚Äôm disappointed in this. There‚Äôs nothing we can even do..
2025-02-21T15:23:20Z,And people were saying apple would pull out of uk before they allowed this to happen.
2025-02-21T16:05:01Z,How to avoid this: never store anything in the Cloud.
2025-02-21T17:25:54Z,"Alternatively, encrypt your files before storing them in the cloud"
2025-02-21T18:14:48Z,"Utterly stupid move by the government.

I‚Äôm really looking forward to when we collectively vote in full fascists in 5, 10, 15 years and they just use all this access to data to find anti-state sentiment or whatever.

Keir Starmer, former human rights lawyer, has been such a massive disappointment"
2025-02-21T18:42:08Z,"Would have sure been nice for Apple to actually warn us that the feature will be disabled in the near future.  I'm disgusted at my Government for pushing this, and would have used the time to remove as much of my encrypted data off iCloud before the deadline.

I'm also saddened that Apple isn't fighting this harder - they were very open and vocal during the Apple-FBI encryption dispute back in 2016.  I recall that Apple declined to create a backdoor due to its policy which required it to never undermine the security features of its products.

They have made some opposition in the past to the proposals that were put into this law, yet the law remains with its ease of being used for overreach.

So here we are - now with unencrypted iCloud features which I had come to value.  However, I am glad they haven't fully rolled over for the belly rub - Keychain, Health, Messages and FaceTime remain encrypted.  Although as it stands, I don't know how much longer for - my trust of my Government is sinking fast with this.

Some pertinent excerpts from Tim Cook's Open Letter during the FBI dispute:

&gt;Customers expect Apple and other¬†technology companies to do everything in our power to protect their personal information, and at Apple we are deeply committed to safeguarding their data.

&gt;Compromising the security of our personal information can ultimately put our personal safety at risk. That is why encryption has become so important to all of us.

[The full letter is archived here](https://web.archive.org/web/20160217084120/http://www.apple.com/customer-letter/).

Another plus point is that the technical notice wanted ***global*** access to any account, not just the UK.  So in a sense Apple are playing some malicious compliance here - just wish it wasn't with my data."
2025-02-21T19:10:40Z,"I think it's worth adding this as I haven't seen anyone talking about it: Unfortunately, the way that TCNs work in the UK is that the company is given a certain timeframe to comply, and they must still comply even if they intend to appeal or have already started the appeals process. Apple may have done this to ""comply"" with the absolute minimum required by the TCN while they are appealing it. Time will only tell."
2025-02-21T20:34:06Z,"I‚Äôm now concerned that other governments will simply force Apple to withdraw end to end encryption to get what they want.

I‚Äôm also wondering how they plan to disable it for any existing users. They will probably have to force those users to route either agree to decrypt their data or disable iCloud backup."
2025-02-22T04:53:24Z,"The only one to blame here is the UK government. While you can criticize Apple for going along with this, the government is ultimately responsible."
2025-02-21T17:47:03Z,Steve Jobs would have pulled Apple from the UK to make a point.
2025-02-21T15:26:45Z,So now EU will request it too and Apple will do the same thing
2025-02-21T15:38:51Z,"Actually, the UK‚Äôs move violated the EU‚Äôs GDPR and cybersecurity laws, which will cause major issues for the UK, who is no longer a member of the EU. The EU was against this move by the UK government."
2025-02-21T15:45:10Z,I really hope this wasn‚Äôt a precedent
2025-02-21T15:48:57Z,Same here.
2025-02-21T16:35:16Z,"GDPR (brought it under the Data Protection Act here) is still in force and it was always enforced by each country's own information commisioners office. EU membership is not relevant here.  

And it doesn't strictly breach the DPA as the UK Government doesn't act as a data controller or the data processor yet. That role is still with Apple, until they start handing any data over (or allowing access to it, however you want to phrase it)  

Either way, we won't know whether the new Online Safety Act would take precedence until someone tries it in court.  

I agree with you and I'm disguisted by our government and Apple's move, but it's important to provide extra context where it's necesary."
2025-02-21T15:17:51Z,I imagine the people that buy this phone arn‚Äôt the type to preorder. They are more likely to walk in the store and buy one.
2025-02-21T15:20:56Z,"Plus, the price isn‚Äôt great"
2025-02-21T15:29:33Z,"The price range going from 599 to 899 is wild, I thought it was like 399 until I manually checked. You can get an older flagship for much less."
2025-02-21T15:46:13Z,I think most people with old phones who would buy this don‚Äôt follow tech blogs and wouldn‚Äôt even think about storage space. And would most likely land on the 599 version.
2025-02-21T18:30:43Z,"I see this as the phone people buy for other people. Probably a pretty big market for people buying for their teens and elderly parents.

Even though personally, I‚Äôd buy a 14 pro over this if I had to buy for a future teenager, most people won‚Äôt care enough"
2025-02-22T00:17:37Z,"yea but where can you find an iPhone 14pro with monthly payment and warranty? I'm with you, I would do the same thing but I wouldnt buy a used phone for my parents or grandparents, too much hassel. This phone is already seeing really good discounts from prepaid carriers (straight talk, total, offering it for $300 off). I bet legacy carriers will offer it for even less with a monthly credit. I bet they move a ton of this just based on price. Heck my inlaws were using iPhone XR until a few months ago and they were serving their needs just fine."
2025-02-22T02:26:45Z,Apple refurbished is a safe bet.
2025-02-21T15:35:59Z,Why on earth did you think it was going to be less than the SE?
2025-02-21T23:21:48Z,They took out features that have been on all iphones for half a decade like magsafe and the UWB chip.
2025-02-22T06:26:35Z,An older flagship will need to be replaced sooner.
2025-02-21T15:52:56Z,"The price is awful, the 512GB is only ‚Ç¨40 less than I paid for my 512GB Pixel 9 Pro XL"
2025-02-21T22:18:10Z,"""Oh shit my phone broke, i need the cheapest iphone you have."""
2025-02-21T15:58:08Z,Yeah. These are the ‚Äúincluded‚Äù phones when people go to change or update their phone plan or have a new phone credit from their provider and want a new phone but don‚Äôt want to put any money down on it or think it will be just fine for their kid.
2025-02-21T22:02:39Z,This will be the phone carriers give for free for signing up with their highest priced plans.
2025-02-21T20:55:00Z,This. Those upgrading to a 16e have a shit android or a previous se model. Those who wanted the 16 already have one.im looking at getting two of these to upgrade my parents off their shitty androids. They are well past time for an upgrade.
2025-02-21T23:50:44Z,Even if I really needed a new phone and wanted this I would want to wait to see how the new apple modem works in reviews. Reports said it took them years longer and was way harder than they expected so who knows how it turned out
2025-02-21T15:18:13Z,"I truly don‚Äôt think anyone knows about it. I‚Äôve seen nothing about it outside of this subreddit and Macrumours, and if I didn‚Äôt visit both the launch would have passed me by."
2025-02-21T16:58:28Z,"I don‚Äôt remember the previous SE announcement being something normal people knew about either though. This is more of a, person walks into a store and asks for the cheapest way to get an iPhone and the sales person can now say ‚ÄúiPhone 16e‚Äù that looks almost like current iPhones instead of like a many years older model. 

I just don‚Äôt feel like SE launches have ever been for most people. Apple would release this with the other iPhones if it was meant to have a ton of fanfare."
2025-02-21T15:23:46Z,Same.  Usually any iPhone launch makes it's way into the norm news cycle for a day or two but I haven't seen any mention of it.
2025-02-21T15:31:48Z,"I mean this one just don‚Äôt make any sense. You can buy older gen flagships for the same price, the SE was always the budget line. So who with an actual budget is gonna buy a 600‚Ç¨ phone over a 700‚Ç¨ full spec phone?¬†


Like at that point anyone with a real lack of money is buying older variants, and everyone else with no clue going to their shop asking for the cheapest upgrade isn‚Äôt pre ordering.¬†"
2025-02-21T15:45:05Z,760eur for the base model in Sweden. Absolute joke of a price tbh.
2025-02-21T15:45:57Z,"yeah, and if you can afford 600, you can likely afford 7/800 for the proper iphone 16

wonder how they decided on this price"
2025-02-21T15:24:27Z,This shouldn‚Äôt come as a surprise. The target market for this device don‚Äôt even know it exists yet. They‚Äôll learn about it when they walk into an Apple Store to upgrade their 5 year old phone and it‚Äôs the cheapest option available
2025-02-21T15:31:30Z,"Every financial services business I‚Äôve worked for in the past 10 years provision the SE (or earlier variants) as the default corporate device, buying hundreds of them."
2025-02-21T15:35:44Z,"Yea, this‚Äôll be the standard corporate phone to give employees"
2025-02-21T18:55:54Z,"Our hospitals work phones are all SEs. Bought by the literal container load. 

People really don't understand how simple IT likes their MDM duties and just how much easier iOS devices are to have out in the hands of the masses. 

Nobody wants to use some broke ass Android phone to pull up the EMR."
2025-02-21T16:05:58Z,"at least in the US, but in other parts of the world they buy a 100 usd cheap android phone that lags even at making calls."
2025-02-21T17:04:51Z,Those parts of the world are irrelevant to Apple in the scale of things. This is carefully designed to be a standard corporate phone.
2025-02-21T16:23:37Z,"I‚Äôm not saying those don‚Äôt exist, but phones have come a long way.

Even a budget phone can be perfectly usable.

But what do I know, I‚Äôm old. I remember waiting 20 minutes, just to look at a picture of boobs."
2025-02-21T17:57:55Z,"Budget phones can be perfectly usable nowadays. Got my mom a Samsung A35 which I bought for 220‚Ç¨ and it's great for what she does - calling and texting, watching YouTube and not much else. All you need for that is a good screen.

I wouldn't really get anything much cheaper than that though, the processors are so bad that it will be laggy out of the box."
2025-02-21T17:21:20Z,"Here the default corp device seems to be the Samsung A35, which got nice hw and is more than fast enough, you can get that for 250‚Ç¨ with enterprise support. And Android is easier to handle in a corporate Microsoft environment with mdm/mam. Set one up today and there is 0 difference in UI speed to my personal iPhone 16."
2025-02-21T17:59:38Z,Yeah cheap phones have gotten pretty good
2025-02-21T19:06:41Z,Our company made 23Ms in January. Same old 6 year old work phone that‚Äôs super laggy and outdated lol. And our Christmas bonus was a super bad quality long sleeve t shirt.
2025-02-21T15:35:48Z,My last two company phones have been SE‚Äôs. Perfectly fine phone to answer quick emails and call into teams meetings. Not everyone needs a flagship phone for everything.
2025-02-21T16:05:51Z,What if someone does a sick kickflip in the office and you need a fisheye?
2025-02-21T17:06:50Z,Exactly this. It literally doesn‚Äôt matter what prices. The real price offered to corporations is not the sticker prices nor do they care. They don‚Äôt pay outright but as monthly installments as a contract.
2025-02-21T22:39:02Z,"That's what I don't get about everyone whining about how this phone is ""too expensive"" or is ""missing features"" or whatever. It is clearly, utterly and blatantly meant to be a corporate fleet phone, purchased (or leased) by the hundreds, not a personal phone that someone seeks out and buys because they've fallen in love with it."
2025-02-21T15:22:10Z,No consumer is expected to buy this phone outright. Apple knows it. This is the corporate device and $0 carrier phone.
2025-02-21T16:25:37Z,"I‚Äôm crossing my fingers for a $5 a month deal from my provider, *so* hard.

All four of my parents need new phones."
2025-02-21T16:40:35Z,How do you have four parents?
2025-02-21T17:59:23Z,Group project
2025-02-21T16:43:28Z,He married his sister? /s
2025-02-21T23:13:57Z,If you marry your sister you still have just 2 parents. You have to marry a cousin if you want to get two more parents silly!
2025-02-22T20:15:44Z,Your biological parents and your in-laws :)
2025-02-21T16:28:54Z,Why? I‚Äôve bought the prior iPhone se‚Äôs. Is this one not worth it?
2025-02-21T16:56:36Z,"Prior iPhones SE were true budget models because the production of newer iPhone chips is more and more expensive due to the fault-prone processor making processes. The previous SE used the price-stable well-developed A15 chip. It‚Äôs clear the older SE was THE budget model fighting in the mid-budget space.

With potential tariffs, Apple has recalibrated the price ladder of the iPhone again with this new release. The 16e is no longer the budget model but the subsidised (by carriers or corporate) model. The price closeness to the base 16 models hints that Apple wants most of their customers paying full price to buy the base 16. Starting with the future iPhone 17, the previous year model will also likely be the budget model again.

Just to note that Apple had attempted this affordable model before with the IPhone 5C and XR. Those happened because the main iPhone model was too expensive at the time."
2025-02-21T16:02:10Z,The $430 iPhone SE 3 [reportedly sold out in 3 days](https://bgr.com/tech/apples-new-iphone-se-3-is-sold-out-which-shouldnt-be-a-surprise/)
2025-02-21T18:22:30Z,"That's because it was priced right, this isn't."
2025-02-21T22:57:21Z,"I mean even the cheaper one took 3 days. OP's article only waited ""some hours""."
2025-02-22T00:02:30Z,"I'm broke, so even a small discount on the iPhone 16 would have been enough to get me to buy. But the lack of magsafe...that's a bridge too far. 

I was the perfect consumer for this stupidly overpriced product, but even I can't get on board."
2025-02-22T00:31:19Z,"I was very much expecting to buy this day one, but I was also expecting this to include magsafe so I also have zero interest in this. I think the lack of magsafe and other features would be acceptable if it was still at the SE price point, as it would feel more 'fair' and you could then at least just get a case with magsafe if it's important. But at the current price, the base 15 or 16 just seems like a better value (or just waiting if you can)."
2025-02-21T17:05:04Z,Horrible price for what it offers. The 15 is on sale for less than this one and sometimes free as well. They really bombed this one. Should've been $499 or $549 especially lacking the U1 and MagSafe which many I know use.
2025-02-21T15:33:06Z,I doubt most people even know that it was released.
2025-02-21T15:29:07Z,"Knowing that the iPhone 17 is just a few months away, I think I‚Äôm just going to have my SE3 hang on for a few more months to see if the price drops. Not worth $599. Would have been an instant buy at $499."
2025-02-21T19:56:04Z,Watch the iphone 17 start for 100-200 dollars more than the 16
2025-02-22T07:08:00Z,Then my days of using an iPhone are over.
2025-02-21T19:49:47Z,"It‚Äôs ‚Ç¨730, no way in hell I‚Äôm spending that on a 60hz notched phone, couldn‚Äôt care less about the ai junk"
2025-02-21T17:14:08Z,I don't know who this is supposed to be for.
2025-02-22T03:32:38Z,"If you go with ‚Äúe‚Äù standing for ‚Äúenterprise‚Äù, then all of a sudden it all makes complete sense.

Nobody suggesting this phone will fail has given even a second‚Äôs thought to corporate purchasers. This is the employee phone that thousands of corporations and companies in Apple‚Äôs target markets will buy in the quantity of hundreds. 

*Then* you add in the irregular buyers who don‚Äôt care about tech specs and just want the cheapest iPhone, who don‚Äôt watch the keynotes or follow tech news."
2025-02-21T15:21:09Z,Yeah it's not for enthusiasts that buy right away
2025-02-21T15:26:10Z,"Preorder fanatics go after the top of the line releases, not bottom of the line."
2025-02-21T15:53:29Z,"I have no room in my hand, space in my pocket or money in my wallet for these gigantic phones. I am sticking with my mini and when it‚Äôs done I‚Äôll buy another one used."
2025-02-21T21:52:58Z,same. i can‚Äôt fathom having a phone larger than my 13 mini.
2025-02-21T15:35:08Z,"This is a long term phone. It will be a solid base model for 2-3 years.


Maybe it gets a $50 price drop at some point (or a storage upgrade). And probably a new color."
2025-02-21T15:35:37Z,They will probably sell them to companies for employee phones.
2025-02-21T16:09:03Z,No wonder. For 100‚Ç¨ more I can buy a S24 Ultra which is the alternative to the 16 Pro Max...
2025-02-21T16:27:28Z,My wife‚Äôs gonna buy one but is in no rush. Looks like she might be able to wait for the first round of discounts.
2025-02-21T16:53:16Z,"Why would anybody be rushing to buy it? Anybody waiting around on an iPhone launch is probably going to be tuned into tech and will likely be more interested in the higher end models. This is a phone for people who don‚Äôt care about phones, for teens asking for a new phone for Christmas, for parents seeking the cheapest option. All they know is that they want an iPhone."
2025-02-21T19:55:50Z,I was so ready to buy one and got the 16 instead. Lack of MagSafe was my reason.
2025-02-21T15:20:49Z,"I‚Äôm sure people are tired of reading this all the times in these threads but here in Europe, in most countries, not all, this thing is 700‚Ç¨ (vat included).It‚Äôs straight up not a good deal, you can get a used 15 pro for that money, the compromises are too many compared to the 16 and the price ratio. If you‚Äôre coming from an older SE and see that price I am not sure you‚Äôre that enticed"
2025-02-21T15:30:07Z,"&gt; If you‚Äôre coming from an older SE and see that price I am not sure you‚Äôre that enticed

I‚Äôm still using my SE2 that *really* needs an upgrade. I was waiting for the SE4 to drop assuming I‚Äôd pick it up. I am definitely not excited about the 16e and have started looking at finding a used 15 instead perhaps‚Ä¶"
2025-02-21T16:30:40Z,"Apple products have *never* been a good deal, in Europe.

But Europe doesn‚Äôt get good deals, in general. So who really cares."
2025-02-21T15:58:43Z,This phone isn‚Äôt for enthusiasts who preorder.
2025-02-21T16:11:42Z,"This model caters to low information, price sensitive iPhone customers who upgrade irregularly. It's not the new Pro announced in September with exciting stuff onboard, there was never gonna be a rush. iPhone 5C energy.

Truthfully an iPhone 15 is probably a better fit for most 16e customers."
2025-02-21T15:23:36Z,"I actually pre-ordered one from XfinityMobile for my girlfriend. We're trading in her iPhone 12 Mini, after trade in and bill credits are applied, I pay $14.58/mo for 24 mo which equates to about $350. 

Definitely worth it and a huge upgrade for her."
2025-02-21T15:30:58Z,It will take a lot more for me to give up my 13 mini
2025-02-21T15:35:19Z,"So her 12 mini is out of storage, has had some water damage in the past, phone glitches all the time because I think the digitizer might be toast....it's just time for an upgrade...the battery is also shit lol"
2025-02-21T16:30:22Z,"It was rumoured to be $499 or *maybe* $549, the price really threw everyone off. It would have been instabuy at $499."
2025-02-21T15:20:51Z,I fully expect this to be the worst selling iPhone ever released.
2025-02-21T16:17:19Z,"iPhone 5c: ""I'm in danger"""
2025-02-21T15:40:40Z,"Lmao people really have short-memory to forget how well the iPhone Xr which was pricier and way more ¬´¬†sub-par¬†¬ª spec wise versus the 16e sold.

Most selling phone of 2019 by far. Almost 50% more sales than the 2nd one of the same year and 3% of all the phones sold that year worldwide."
2025-02-21T16:30:26Z,"https://old.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/9pi0lu/introducing_iphone_xr_apple/e824gcm/

It's fun looking back at this little window in time."
2025-02-21T17:39:44Z,"But that was the ""regular"" iphone for that generation, as the other one was the Xs, which was the ""pro"" iphone for that generation. The regular iphone for this gen already exists, its called the 16."
2025-02-21T16:38:45Z,"It‚Äôs going to sell *so* many units to businesses buying whatever the cheapest iPhone is in bulk, plus non-techy consumers who just walk into their carrier store for their ‚Äúupgrade‚Äù to their five year old phone and pick whichever one is cheapest and couldn‚Äôt possibly care about the differences between models. This will be the default ‚Äúadd a line and get a free phone‚Äù iPhone, and that moves a *lot* of units.

Is it a good deal? No, it‚Äôs overpriced for what you get. Would an informed consumer pick it over last year‚Äôs flagship or a refurbished iPhone? Nope. But those aren‚Äôt the target audiences for this product."
2025-02-21T17:08:30Z,Pretty sure Corporations are already putting their order in as a IPhone SE replacement.
2025-02-21T15:23:31Z,would the price go down when 17 is released ?
2025-02-21T15:35:58Z,"Doubtful. They‚Äôre not going to price drop a 6 month old product. 

More likely they discontinue the iPhone 16 and make the 16e the entry level option, which is the de facto ‚Äúprice drop‚Äù for the 16 line."
2025-02-21T15:44:42Z,"You can‚Äôt really judge sales by this method anymore lol. The iPhone sold really well last September yet many models took over a week before they sold out. The Apple Watch also sold really well yet most models didn‚Äôt go out of stock. 

Apple have vastly improved their chain to minimise outages but also the cheaper models have never instantly gone out of stock, not even the new colours of the main line that Apple used to launch."
2025-02-21T15:47:09Z,"No one rushes to buy the new Samsung A25 either. Or the new Moto Stylus. The people that preorder phones are the type that buy the latest and greatest phones, which are the the pro models, or if they don't have the money the base model. 

Everyone else buys when they need a replacement."
2025-02-21T16:31:31Z,"This isn't a day-1 preorder type of product. Those who will purchase it don't even know it exists yet. So far, it's likely just tech bros and YouTubers who purchased just to review it and will return it."
2025-02-21T16:34:20Z,"I hate to say that I fell for the marketing strat. I‚Äôve been holding on to a SE2020 since launch. It has gotten to the point where the phone will not wireless charge and the lightning port is fucked. I promised myself that I would buy the new SE the day it was available. When I saw the new iPhone though, I was tremendously disappointed by the price. I spent all day trying to justify the $700 price tag (for 256 gb) but I couldn‚Äôt. I spent all of the next day looking up android phones, but I couldn‚Äôt find anything that appealed to me. So last night, I said fuck it and bought a regular 16 because I felt it made more sense to spend the extra $200 to get the better phone when my other option was an expensive pile of dog shit."
2025-02-21T18:37:22Z,"It‚Äôs very poor value. I was looking forward to the next ‚ÄúSE‚Äù, but this isn‚Äôt it for me. If it was $100 less, sure."
2025-02-21T20:54:56Z,I was going to buy it until I saw the price tag. Guess I‚Äôll be hanging on to my SE for a bit longer.
2025-02-21T21:21:21Z,"and you‚Äôll keep hanging onto it, I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôll be another cheaper iPhone ever again, but there are alternatives, to be honest past models of iPhones are still great so a refurbished or used iPhone would do just fine"
2025-02-21T23:02:37Z,It‚Äôs too expensive for a cheap iPhone.
2025-02-21T23:13:37Z,"This is the fleet phone, this is what everyone gets at their work who gets their phone as a ""perk"""
2025-02-22T20:59:29Z,Who would want to? It‚Äôs a terrible offering at a terrible price. iPhone SE buyers want their $400 phone back. And everybody else realizes that the iPhone 15 is a better value.
2025-02-22T21:10:18Z,Who would? People would be wise to cough up more for a 16 or wait for a sale on the 16e
2025-02-23T02:21:07Z,"Let‚Äôs be honest, the thing costs 100-200 too much. 600 dollars isn‚Äôt exactly a crazy good price for what you‚Äôre getting with this thing."
2025-02-23T11:58:55Z,It‚Äôs an enterprise device
2025-02-22T09:09:25Z,"Curious to see how well it works with really edge cases on the edge of reception, car park basements with little signal etc

At least apple can update its software for years instead of relying on vendors"
2025-02-22T11:36:49Z,"&gt; Apple tested the C1 with over 180 carriers across 55 countries to ensure that it delivers reliable connectivity. The C1 is designed to integrate with the A18 chip, with the A18 able to optimize C1 network load for faster speeds.

Apple is very careful to make sure this is stated."
2025-02-22T21:41:42Z,While they may be careful it‚Äôs also telling that it‚Äôs getting rolled out on their budget phone and not their flagship. They need the data from millions of devices running in the real world that just can‚Äôt be replicated in a lab.im sure this will generally be a decent chip but the C2 and c3 are where we‚Äôll likely see big improvements.
2025-02-22T21:53:40Z,"Even Apple isn‚Äôt stupid enough to think there isn‚Äôt gremlins waiting to pop out. 

Qualcomm has had decades and billions of devices to refine their craft. 

There is zero chance Apple nails edge cases it‚Äôs just not possible."
2025-02-22T12:44:46Z,"could be good, could be bad, we'll have to see. that's where Intel modem doesn't do really well compared to Qualcomm."
2025-02-22T09:08:14Z,"Personally, I really hope that in-house modems makes cellular connectivity the default on most (non-budget) iPads and MacBooks."
2025-02-22T18:16:54Z,And miss the chance to upsell the cellular versions? Don't get any hopes.
2025-02-23T01:32:54Z,"Qualcomm charges a percentage of the MSRP of the device for modem royalties.

At the very least, these modems could come to MacBooks now. I think that‚Äôs why there was never a cellular MacBook before"
2025-02-23T01:44:13Z,"Na, Qualcomm's [licensing percentage of the MSRP is capped at $400, so that's not a problem](https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/qualcomm-cuts-cap-for-phone-licensing-fees-hopes-to-settle-with-apple-this-year/)

It just depends on if Apple believes there's a market for laptops with cellular connection"
2025-02-23T03:22:37Z,"Lol ok. Capped at $400‚Ä¶ but could still be eating $200 or the cap of $400 out of their $1000 flagship, which is 20%-40% of the MSRP."
2025-02-23T05:59:22Z,"It's [3.25% of MSRP up to the $400 cap](https://www.electronicsweekly.com/news/business/qualcomm-cap-value-handset-400-royalty-calculations-2018-04/)

i.e. the max Qualcomm gets is only $14"
2025-02-23T06:07:34Z,"From an online source, it‚Äôs stating $23 per modem plus $8 in patent fees. Either way, it costs them billions annually."
2025-02-22T21:43:55Z,I‚Äôm hoping it allows them to create a more stable mesh network for their devices. Apple devices already talk to each other pretty well but having control of the chips so that they talk seamlessly with each other and things can switch unnoticed would be game changing.
2025-02-22T03:41:59Z,"Google needs to take notes, this is how a modem is certified and tested."
2025-02-22T06:59:37Z,Did Google ever make a modem though
2025-02-22T07:01:08Z,"Well modems are part of SOC, which of course Google names theirs Tensor. They certainly don‚Äôt test them enough either."
2025-02-22T09:15:20Z,"Apple uses a discrete Qualcomm chipset, but Google‚Äôs SoC integrates Samsungs‚Äôs Exynos modem."
2025-02-22T13:23:16Z,"Actually Google's Tensor AP SoC don't have integrated modems, Google uses Samsungs‚Äôs discrete Exynos modem

The likely reason Google had modem issues is probably because they are essentially Samsung's only customer for discrete modems

Hence Samsung probably hadn't really done as much testing/optimisation vs their widely used Exynos AP SoCs with integrated modems"
2025-02-22T13:32:13Z,"Qualcomm, Samsung and MediaTek's AP SoCs have integrated modems

But Apple &amp; Google's AP SoCs don't have integrated modems. Apple and Google use discrete modems

Hence how Apple can swap to their own C1 modems for the 16E without impacting the A18

Here's more [info on Tensor's lack of integrated modem](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/1iv6v65/heres_a_look_at_apples_secret_modem_testing_lab/me5ro5q/)"
2025-02-23T02:26:03Z,Any documented and quantified advantage of integrated over discrete?
2025-02-23T03:00:09Z,"Cost is easily the biggest advantage of integrated over discrete. Integrating the modem means the modem can share various system components from the AP SoC

We'll have to wait to die shots, but Apple's C1 likely has its own small CPU (maybe tiny Arm or RISC-V cores). Hence an integrated modem usually adds around 10-15mm2. Haven't seen die hots for discrete modems in a long time, but I'd guess they'll likely be around 30-50mm2, maybe 2-3x more transistors

Discrete modems are usually built on a slightly older, AFAIK Qualcomm's latest modems use Samsung's 4nm process (instead of TSMC 3nm). But still it costs more as it's an additional chip, built on a costly leading edge process, and licensing costs for additional CPU cores

Integrated modems should be more efficient than discrete modems. But that's bascially impossible to test/quantify. But clearly sharing resources instead of duplicating should have minor power savings. As well as TSMC 3nm vs Samsung 4nm

That's essentially why Nvidia/TI/Intel had to drop out, while Samsung/MediaTek integrated their own modems to keep up with Qualcomm

Apple will definitely integrate their modems later, but it's something we might not see for 1-3 years since discrete modems allows for easiler development/testing"
2025-02-22T12:42:12Z,Google seems to switch to a Mediatek modem (which is quite better than Exynos) when they switch to TSMC.
2025-02-22T09:52:53Z,You don't think google does the same. Apple most likely did the same testing with their intel modem and that was a bad one
2025-02-22T11:34:38Z,"It‚Äôs not THAT bad considering there was no major -gate about it. Pixel had a 911 bug and their modem is still iffy. https://www.androidauthority.com/psa-google-pixel-911-emergency-calling-issues-3362990/

If Google had a ‚Äúsecret‚Äù testing lab they would have invited media to visit everyday."
2025-02-22T16:54:02Z,Every company that does hardware have ‚Äúsecret‚Äù testing labs where they test their hardware. Apple inviting people to see theirs is just a PR move. Even spinning it as particularly secret is just marketing spin.
2025-02-23T07:46:10Z,"Frankly I don‚Äôt think Google ever fully validated their modems fully beyond what was tested by Samsung which made it. Google promoted their Camera and quantum computing labs. If they had a modem testing lab they would have promoted it.

2025-02-22T09:06:32Z,"### Summary

Apple‚Äôs first in-house C1 modem chip, debuting in the iPhone 16e, represents a significant strategic pivot from Qualcomm dependency toward comprehensive vertical integration. Manufactured using advanced 4nm baseband and 7nm transceiver processes, this silicon breakthrough enables real-time communication with the A18 processor, facilitating dynamic traffic management across cellular networks while supporting satellite connectivity features despite lacking millimeter wave 5G capabilities in its initial iteration.

The development process entailed rigorous validation through sophisticated simulations, stress tests exceeding tens of thousands of power cycles, and extensive carrier compatibility verification with 180+ providers spanning 55 countries‚Äîmethodologies overseen by key executives including Johny Srouji, Kaiann Drance, and Arun Mathias in Apple‚Äôs specialized testing facilities.

Beyond the immediate performance enhancements evidenced by the iPhone 16e‚Äôs record-setting battery life for a 6.1-inch model, this technology establishes the foundation for a unified connectivity architecture across Apple‚Äôs ecosystem, simultaneously reducing external licensing expenditures while granting unprecedented control over hardware integration that portends evolutionary refinements in subsequent C-series modems.‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã"
2025-02-22T11:22:20Z,I guess this will be a huge loss of money for Qualcomm if Apple stops buying all the modems from them.
2025-02-23T15:12:07Z,"Currently, 22% of Qualcomm revenue comes from iPhone sales"
2025-02-22T12:33:46Z,"I'm curious and excited.

I'm also in the need of a new phone sooner than later, and for very specific reasons I'll need to stick to iPhones for probably the next handful of years.

Now... for me cheaper is better and I don't care much about the lost features.

# BUT...

I'm also not a complete Apple newbie... and ""version 1.0"" Apple products aren't exactly famous for being stable. I've been burned by 1.0 products from them before, so I'll wait as long as I can before replacing my phone with either this or like base 15.

A version 1.0 of their first cellphone antenna gives me pause."
2025-02-22T13:30:48Z,Yeah definitely don‚Äôt want to pay to be their beta tester. Rumor is the iPhone 17 models will still use Qualcomm.
2025-02-22T17:43:58Z,A lot of the v1 problems were from early runs of the first device. A lot of time people that got the same device but six months later didn‚Äôt have the problem. Apple definitely does undocumented manufacturing tweaks.
2025-02-22T23:06:06Z,Is there going to be a modem in a new Apple phone
2025-02-23T06:40:29Z,So secret they give you tours. Of course the second there‚Äôs a fucking problem with it they‚Äôll stop responding to requests. Why do journalists eat this slop up without calling out the shit behaviour?
2025-02-23T22:47:26Z,Another shit Apple propaganda piece
2025-02-22T17:40:35Z,Qualcomm will take Apple to court as soon as this is for sale. Qualcomm honestly believes that they own the patent rights for cellular transmission in the US.
2025-02-22T22:51:29Z," who cares though, just two corps gettin at each other"
2025-02-23T19:30:33Z,Thise two corps control the internet connectivity for 80% of US devices and one of them (Qualcomm) thinks they legally they should be the only one.
2025-02-24T19:40:54Z,"Apple is designing the modem, not manufacturing it. They will give the blueprints to Qualcomm and they will build it. Same with the A/M series chips, the displays and probably much more."
2025-02-24T20:03:11Z,Apple doesn‚Äôt want Qualcomm to build it. Thats the whole point. Apple sees Qualcomm as a greedy threat and they want to cut all ties from them. They‚Äôve been trying to get there for many years.

2025-02-21T18:17:47Z,"From the post:

When Apple unveils its four new flagship iPhone 17 models this fall, I expect to see big pricing changes.

Likely something along these lines:

iPhone 16e: $599

iPhone 16: $749

iPhone 16 Plus: $849

iPhone 17: $899

iPhone 17 Air: $999

iPhone 17 Pro: $1,099

iPhone 17 Pro Max: $1,299

Essentially, every model will get more expensive by as much as $100. The new 17 Air will take the iPhone Pro‚Äôs $999 slot, pushing the Pro models to yet-unseen heights."
2025-02-21T21:58:30Z,Same but the 16 at $699 and 16 Plus at $799. So a $100 step up every time until the Pro
2025-02-22T00:04:50Z,Add another $100 to those prices because Apple will claim that they aren't gonna take the costs tariffs any more. Even though they made up for them with the extra-extra high prices in Europe anyway.
2025-02-22T02:27:54Z,Even while they cut Qualcomm and Broadcomm out of their modems and WIFI and stop paying that much in patent royalties.
2025-02-22T03:41:42Z,the pro will likely keep for faster speeds (for now)
2025-02-22T13:42:24Z,They will still pay for patents
2025-02-22T10:36:54Z,More expensive yet switching to aluminum from titanium. Sad.
2025-02-21T23:30:06Z,"Apple made this mistake with Macs in the mid-90s and it drove them nearly bankrupt, before Jobs came back and made a deal with Microsoft and set a new product strategy.

I can't believe we see Apple's worst instincts come out again.

iPhones don't exist in isolation. I can get a $300 Android that runs CIRCLES around this 16e PoS. People are noticing."
2025-02-22T04:07:04Z,I actually don‚Äôt think people will stop buying iPhones. What‚Äôs more likely is people‚Äôs upgrade cycle extending. People who used to upgrade every year will do every other year. People who upgrade every 2 years will do it every 3-4 years.
2025-02-22T10:13:54Z,"I think most people are already this way. I don't know anyone who upgrades yearly except diehards, almost Apple zealots. I think most people are already every 3-4 years. The thing about the iterative updates is there isn't much reason to upgrade any sooner. The only time I ever did an annual update was iPhone 1 to iPhone 3G. After that, it was every other model, since about the 7 or so, I've waited at least 3-4 years. So went from 7 to 11 to 15 or so. It also makes the upgrades feel a lot more substantial."
2025-02-22T07:57:08Z,And they honestly need to keep them longer than only 4 years..
2025-02-22T15:50:56Z,"Seeing how this trend goes, I‚Äôd be keeping my 4 year old iPhone 12 Pro for scorer 2 years. By then I might upgrade to 16"
2025-02-21T23:50:41Z,"In the US I don‚Äôt think an extra $100 will matter much. I‚Äôve had iPhones since my 5s, I won‚Äôt even consider an Android at this point. The issue Apple has is people are upgrading less frequently because the improvements are just too incremental at this point. I don‚Äôt think many people are replacing their iPhones until they quit working well, at which point they‚Äôll simply swallow the higher price."
2025-02-22T02:01:16Z,"That‚Äôs me, I use to be someone who would update every year, now I‚Äôll stick with what I have till it needs to be replaced. Also I won‚Äôt switch to android everyone in my social/family circle is on iPhone and it‚Äôs just easier to communicate and stay in the eco system."
2025-02-22T00:39:52Z,still rocking my 12PM and dont see letting it go anytime soon.  Not a single one of the newer phones do anything extra i need and in fact it seems photo quality has gone down hill since in various areas.
2025-02-22T01:36:30Z,"I replaced my 12 pro a year ago. I was excited for the 15 pro max. when I got it... it didn't feel new. it wasn't that much ""faster"" than my 12 pro. it had longer battery life. that's it. I love my 15 pro... but it was no different from any other iPhone. I am not in a rush to get a new one. I'm going to wait for this one to be unusable before getting my next iPhone."
2025-02-22T02:27:46Z,"This happened to me. My 13 pro had some logic board failure out of warranty. I decided to get the 15 pro max and honestly I was mad the entire time I had it because I didn‚Äôt really want it in the first place. I had issue after issue with the 15. I ended up ‚Äúdowngrading‚Äù as some might say, to a 16 plus and I‚Äôm thrilled. I miss nothing and love it just as much as my blue one."
2025-02-22T09:30:49Z,"intellectually i know my 15 pro max is much faster and superior than all my previous iPhones, but really when it comes to the day to day i don‚Äôt feel it. I did notice the change when i moved from m1 to m3 pro mbp and when i got my m4 iPad Pro. But on the iPhone? I know intellectually the specs are superior, but i don‚Äôt feel the magic."
2025-02-22T07:51:09Z,Exactly. All you need to do is get a new battery every couple years and they can literally last YEARS. Im still on a 6s and SE1 and I have absolutely no issues with running apps or browsing the web. I see people upgrading from the 11/12/13 etc and I think that‚Äôs crazy to upgrade that soon when nowadays they last so long.
2025-02-22T11:05:30Z,"6S runs on iOS 15. This is not a supported OS anymore, and while some popular apps are maintained, social networks and so on, there are many which don't work on iOS 15, say you can't install ChatGPT, unlikely your banking app etc. work, and even if they did, it's risky to do it on an unsupported OS (iOS is more secure, but nothing is 100% secure).

I also think the endless software bloat and forced hardware obsolescence is crazy. Crazy, but a fact. SE1 is currently supported, but after 16e, it'll likely be dropped from iOS 19."
2025-02-22T07:34:22Z,Apple did an amazing job at locking people into their ecosystem. There could be android phones double as good and twice as cheap and people still would hesitate to buy them. When using mac/ipad/apple watch NOT having an iphone is just very inconvenient.
2025-02-22T07:48:17Z,"No you can‚Äôt. 

As someone who switched from a 300 dollar Android, the difference between that and an iPhone 16 is night and day."
2025-02-22T01:58:14Z,No $300 Android will run circles around the 16e when nothing but the top Snapdragon can even keep up with the A18 chip.
2025-02-22T06:16:06Z,I think we're reaching a point where that really isn't making a big impact anywhere besides benchmarks. It doesn't take much to scroll social media and send text messages.
2025-02-22T07:55:17Z,Exactly. I don‚Äôt even have problems doing those things on my 6s and it has an A9 chip. Doesn‚Äôt even feel slow and most apps still support iOS 15.
2025-02-22T11:00:40Z,If you‚Äôre still using a 6s in 2025 that is a great argument in favor of buying an iPhone. I don‚Äôt remember what year it came out but it must have been at least 10 years ago.
2025-02-22T07:47:57Z,"My workplace gives out Samsung galaxy A15‚Äôs and they are slow. Outlook and WhatsApp opened? Be ready for lag. Trying to edit settings? Lag. 

Android auto enabled in the car? Better hope someone will call twice because the first time you answer the phone it crashes. It‚Äôs insane."
2025-02-22T00:12:43Z,It is still android.
2025-02-22T02:08:23Z,Exactly this. I bet the number of people that switch phone platforms on hardware specs alone is minuscule. If you don‚Äôt like the software the phone runs and the ecosystem it lives in what is even the point? Just get whatever is the best deal and move on.
2025-02-22T10:37:17Z,"&gt; I can get a $300 Android that runs CIRCLES around this 16e PoS

yes, but that phone immediately drops price 30% once you open the box and another 50% after 1st year. and then you will be lucky if you get regular updates after 2 years. And I am not even talking about performance and security in Android...

you can re-sell iPhone after 2-3 years still for nice price. i14 pro still sells over 500 Euros. Used"
2025-02-22T18:07:25Z,"Why do you care about the pricing lool. I'm sure 99% of the PPL that will buy a 16e aren't looking to sell within a year or two.

Most android phones that are sold now offer 2 OS upgrades and 4 years Security Upgrades. Most ppl usually upgrade after 4/5 years anyway
And not to mention if you know the right phone to pick you can use custom roms etc."
2025-02-21T21:15:18Z,I suspect the 17 will start at $999
2025-02-21T21:42:19Z,No way the starter 17 will start at $200 over the S25
2025-02-22T02:02:02Z,Apple doesn‚Äôt care what other companies prices are.
2025-02-21T18:08:23Z,[deleted]
2025-02-22T12:58:50Z,"I‚Äôve thought about this but it honestly doesn‚Äôt make sense. Apple products last a long time and they retain their resale value relatively well. Like the iPhone 16 Pro is $999 right now, or you can get ‚Äúone generation back‚Äù for like $800. The $200 cost savings doesn‚Äôt really add up when you realize you‚Äôre also paying for a year off its lifecycle and also trusting the person before you cared appropriately for the phone."
2025-02-22T18:51:01Z,[deleted]
2025-02-22T19:08:10Z,"Yep, you run the phone until the wheels fall off. A couple battery swaps and a 16 PM could last 6-8 years, assuming no other issues."
2025-02-22T14:38:22Z,welcome to most of the population.    Upgrading devices yearly has been insane behavior for quite awhile now.
2025-02-21T17:12:22Z,"Tbf, with Tariffs coming this was rather expected. I mean the iPhone X - iPhone 16 prices have basically stayed the same. Taking inflation into account, iPhones have gotten cheaper over most of the past decade."
2025-02-21T17:28:00Z,No it‚Äôs not about tariffs. 16e is much more expensive abroad.
2025-02-21T18:54:24Z,All iPhones are expensive outside US due to most countries imposing import duties. These are usually higher for latest releases.
2025-02-21T23:47:27Z,And also we (Europe) include VAT (like sales tax) in our prices.
2025-02-21T17:37:58Z,That‚Äôs always the case with iPhones. It‚Äôs usually partly due to tax being included in the advertised price in other countries.
2025-02-21T18:40:14Z,"The point is that if the price has only increased due to tariffs, then you would expect *only* the US price to increase. But the prices are equivalent to the US price worldwide, so Apple has increased the pricing regardless of the tariffs."
2025-02-21T17:45:40Z,"But this time it's ridiculous. A 16e with 256Gb costs 829‚Ç¨. The S24 Ultra which is the alternative to the iPhone 16 Pro Max costs 899‚Ç¨. For 70‚Ç¨ more, you get a massive upgrade which is pretty crazy"
2025-02-21T18:46:45Z,"Even within apples ecosystem, you should be able to get a 14 pro for about the same price, which is still a very capable phone and essentially has all of the features that the 16pro has.

Within apples ecosystem you have parental controls, password sharing and several other reasons it‚Äôs convenient that everyone in your family has an iPhone.

I see this as the phone people buy their kids or elderly parents."
2025-02-21T17:47:59Z,It's for Apple to move up the ladder. I am sure next iPhone Pro starts at $1099 instead.
2025-02-21T17:49:44Z,"15 Pro Max is at 1179‚Ç¨ which is definitely more expensive, but I really can't recommend the 16e to anyone in this price class. At that point you should rather go with the S24U. Apple really can price stuff correctly, e.g. the M4 Mini which was priced at 599‚Ç¨ which honestly surprised me because that's a really good price for this device. It's going to be pretty interesting when the 17 drops and they hopefully keep the price"
2025-02-21T18:28:54Z,"So a 16e 256 without VAT in Germany is 696‚Ç¨, that‚Äôs within 5% of the price for the US market.¬†

The phone is hardly more expensive in the EU than in the us.¬†"
2025-02-21T18:29:47Z,"So the price is trash in general, not very good from Apple"
2025-02-21T18:37:05Z,Correct.¬†
2025-02-21T18:51:18Z,"Just bought a 16 128 on ebay today for 740‚Ç¨ and a free ebay+ for a year. That‚Äòs 40‚Ç¨ more than the 16e with a better display, better CPU, better camera, pretty much better everything. 
The price of the 16e is ridiculous."
2025-02-22T02:25:49Z,eBay plus lmao that‚Äôs a new one
2025-02-21T17:56:36Z,"That is not the original retail price of the S24 Ultra, Samsung phones just get discounted pretty significantly over the course of the year. This has always been true.

That said, after you remove the VAT and adjust for currency conversion, the 16e is somewhere in the neighborhood of 50 USD more expensive in Europe than in the US. Which is significant - it probably means they think that the EU is going to drop in value and/or the USD is going to increase in value. They're not just charging a near-$100 premium after conversion in the EU for no reason (I say near-$100 because the tariffs would account for another about $50)."
2025-02-21T18:56:18Z,"Conversion is pretty much 1:1 atm. 
And if you take out VAT of roughly 20%, more in many states in the EU, you are well below $600. I see no way the EU pricing is $50 more than the US. 

Or please explain."
2025-02-21T23:49:36Z,Then buy the S24 Ultra.
2025-02-21T18:00:34Z,"Tariff duties are also baked into the price of retail products.  It‚Äôs not like sales tax, like the price of the item will not jump 50% when you go to check out, if we slapped a 50% tariff on smart phone imports.  The iPhone would just become 50% more expensive."
2025-02-21T21:05:05Z,"In New Zealand the base model costs 1199 NZD.  At today‚Äôs exchange rate, 599 USD x 1.15 = 1199.70 NZD (1.15 is the standard 15% gst). So it seems we are actually getting a slight discount of 70 cents."
2025-02-21T17:46:22Z,because the anchor has shifted due to inflation.
2025-02-21T18:26:37Z,They are exercising their pricing power. Simple as that
2025-02-21T17:27:45Z,"Except they have removed charging brick and earphones + made their boxes much thinner allowing them to make some of that money back on AirPods and charging bricks + reduced shipping cost

Also let‚Äôs not forget the X was way overpriced but instead of raising the price every year they bit the bullet so people could complain only once (from 700$ of the iPhone 7 and 650$ the 6S) about the pricing of a 1000$ and get accustomed to it.

Also in Europe the iPhone X was 1159‚Ç¨ euros 
Today with euro to dollar at the same level than in 2017, the iPhone 16 pro costs 1219‚Ç¨  while taxes have not changed.

In essence, your statement is partially correct but also lacks perspective."
2025-02-21T17:46:04Z,"iPhones from a decade ago are virtually the same as today‚Äôs models.

The price hasn‚Äôt gotten cheaper‚Äîthey‚Äôve simply found more cost-effective ways to manufacture them without offering any significant upgrades.

‚Äîwritten from an iPhone X"
2025-02-21T17:57:11Z,"&gt; iPhones from a decade ago are virtually the same as today‚Äôs models.

An iPhone from a decade ago is a 6S, which is substantially worse then today's models in every way. Even from an X the incremental updates mean the new ones are much nicer devices"
2025-02-21T17:05:15Z,"Is anybody else getting the feeling that tech outlets have been absolutely desperate to milk every single penny out of this insignificant release, for some reason?

Not even in a funny way, it seems scarily desperate, for some reason. Like somebody threatening to shoot you mum in the face, desperate."
2025-02-21T17:16:58Z,That‚Äôs just the reality of Apple. They could release an empty cardboard box and we‚Äôd be getting 30 articles a day about it.
2025-02-21T18:18:54Z,"Hi, do you have any details on the rumored upcoming Apple Cardboard that you‚Äôre referring to? I‚Äôm putting together a story now. Interested in any leaked photos or specifications. Thanks!"
2025-02-22T10:14:05Z,You mean the new Cardboard Air? Air because cards are not included.
2025-02-21T17:19:06Z,Not wrong.  Remember their polishing cloth?
2025-02-21T17:23:27Z,"I believe 9to5mac serves as an exemplary case. They possess numerous sister sites dedicated to various topics, including Google, electric vehicles, drones, and more. Such a portfolio was highly effective a decade ago when the tech industry was experiencing rapid growth. However, in today‚Äôs stagnant landscape, they are compelled to resort to low-quality content, publishing articles that lack newsworthiness, to sustain the existence of each site.

I remember following Engadget back in 2007 and new technology blew my mind almost weekly. One iPod model got a redesign every year. Those were the good days."
2025-02-21T18:00:05Z,That‚Äôs  what happens when you pigeonhole yourself to only cover one specific topic that can‚Äôt possibly generate enough news to create an article every day.
2025-02-21T18:56:57Z,"iPhones haven't changed pricing in 5 years, even through inflation. Tariffs on chips and rare metals were always going to hurt the prices."
2025-02-22T07:58:47Z,In Australia the base model of an iPhone 16e Is priced at $999 due to the Apple tax and exchange rate differences. This is so unaffordable nowadays.
2025-02-21T17:15:56Z,"I mean also every single time they‚Äôve added a notch 
 and/or changed the display type, the product‚Äôs have gotten more expensive.

- XR adds Face ID and is $150 more expensive than the cheapest new iPhone it replaced (the 8)
- Retina MBA and M2 MBA both had starting price increases when they came out, before going down
- iPhone 12 moved the base models to OLED and the 6.1‚Äù model went up by $100
- All the iPads went up in base price immediately after adopting the Liquid Retina display
- The good MBP went from $1799 to $1999 after getting Liquid Retina, as did the bad MBP from $1299 to $1599
- Series 4 Apple Watch raised the price by $100 

Any time they make the screen better, the price pretty much always goes up by $100-200, so I‚Äôm not surprised. This is actually pretty in line with every other Apple product that gets a better display than what it replaces."
2025-02-21T17:47:56Z,iPhone 12 oled switch is a good corollary
2025-02-21T18:38:12Z,But apple also release a 12 mini with a slightly lower price
2025-02-21T19:03:56Z,"And when the mini got cut, it took the starting price right back to $799.

The mini is a cheat way to get around that, but the 6.1‚Äù model went from $699 to $799 and it‚Äôs been that since."
2025-02-21T19:09:30Z,Yeah you‚Äôre right. I miss the days where apple had only 1 phone and it was $649
2025-02-21T17:18:43Z,People are fools to think that these tariffs will not open the floodgates for everyone to spike the price even if they are not getting hit by them. You give any company the opportunity to make more money and they will.
2025-02-21T16:59:50Z,"From the article: Apple‚Äôs iPhone 16e launch came with several surprises this week, one of which involved price. And unfortunately, it may not be the last big price change we see on the iPhone this year.

iPhone SE‚Äôs successor lost the SE‚Äôs key feature: low price

In the lead-up to this week‚Äôs Apple announcement, we had a good idea of what to expect from the new iPhone.

For a while now, various reports had the specs right. A18 chip, 8GB of RAM, iPhone 14-style design with Face ID, Apple Intelligence support, USB-C, and more.

Even the new name‚ÄîiPhone 16e‚Äîhad leaked in advance, though there was still a fair amount of skepticism about that change.

We were expecting an iPhone SE successor, and didn‚Äôt exactly get one. The name change itself isn‚Äôt the reason for that, but the price absolutely is.

* iPhone SE: $429
* iPhone 16e: $599

That is no longer a ‚Äòbudget‚Äô smartphone.
Rumors of a price change existed, but they largely pointed to a $499 starting price.

Apple‚Äôs decision to go with $599 hints at more price changes ahead."
2025-02-21T17:26:13Z,Ugh are they going to try to sell the 17 at a higher price and keep the price of the 16 as is after the 17 launches later this year‚Ä¶.
2025-02-21T17:46:21Z,Or maybe just drop $50 instead of the traditional $100
2025-02-21T18:50:10Z,Isn't it just an iphone 16 but with missing parts and a higher price tag?
2025-02-21T21:16:20Z,Yup
2025-02-22T05:04:29Z,"First eggs, now iPhones‚Ä¶"
2025-02-21T17:15:20Z,The iPhone 16e is gonna look amazing once the prices of all consumer electronics rise.
2025-02-21T17:54:47Z,How much of these higher prices are due to the tariffs vs greed from Apple?
2025-02-21T19:05:45Z,Assume all corporations are maximally greedy at all times. No need to moralize it then. They respond to the incentives of the market as defined by consumers and regulators.
2025-02-23T02:34:33Z,Apple didn‚Äôt suddenly become interested mainly in profit. Why this is a surprise to people here shocks me.
2025-02-21T19:32:31Z,"Considering Apple is going to have at least 25% of iPhone production in India next year, I would say tariffs are probably having a minimal impact on pricing. Especially considering how stagnant the price of iPhones has been over the past several years."
2025-02-21T18:31:43Z,"$399, they would have killed it. $499, would have been a great entry point. $599, meh."
2025-02-21T17:02:56Z,"Can't let Samsung be more expensive now can they? Might give people the impression that Galaxy S is more ""pReMiUm""."
2025-02-21T21:45:38Z,S24 ultra same price as 16e is a joke
2025-02-22T21:48:44Z,"After how little changed from my 13 Pro compared to my 16 Pro Max, I likely won‚Äôt upgrade for 3-5 years at least and will definitely buy preowned. I love electronics and admittedly spend too much on them. This phone is over priced and I‚Äôm no longer willing to pay a premium for it."
2025-02-21T17:03:32Z,Not sure why it‚Äôs called unpopular changes while they have a president that threatens his country with taxes. This is what Americans wanted and and they‚Äôll reflect it on the prices by taking advantage of it

‚ÄúApple and its manufacturing partners invested over $200 million in the Mac Pro facility in Austin, building out the complex assembly line where the Mac Pro is produced. ‚Äù 

What they‚Äôre doing now in 2025 is somewhat similar to what they did back in 2019 with the Mac Pro. They‚Äôre investing in production facilities, and building out their manufacturing pipeline here. Apple products are manufactured with parts all around the globe, including parts made by Apple in the US. While final assembly is often done at Foxconn in China, Apple has been slowly trying to diversify."

2025-02-21T20:23:39Z,I think that was going to be used for display panels or TVs or something. I don't think Apple has anything to do with the Wisconsin Foxcon plant.
2025-02-21T20:31:43Z,Apple has nothing to do with [that scam](https://www.theverge.com/c/21507966/foxconn-empty-factories-wisconsin-jobs-loophole-trump).
2025-02-22T06:25:43Z,Foxconn is a big scam.
2025-02-22T06:08:34Z,Land isn‚Äôt the problem. The US has plenty of land
2025-02-23T08:36:22Z,"Yup. And it's still just an empty building. But hey, a certain person got to point to that as ""proof"" he brought jobs back to America. I mean, we got a building, that's something, right?"
2025-02-21T20:10:28Z,Analyst on Bloomberg just called this an outright lie. Since Apple does no manufacturing in Mexico and no plans for Mexico prior to this announcement. Is this true?
2025-02-22T12:40:08Z,"Foxconn, who makes iphones, was planning on building plants in Mexico for the past four years. There are articles going back for years talking about it. It's mostly speculation, but there was constant, serious talks of Foxconn moving Iphone production to mexico and India to avoid the initial tariffs against china. Now with more tariffs in place, they are likely going to produce in the US instead of Mexico"
2025-02-21T17:56:48Z,"Using what labor? TSMC US has the same problems. The skillsets needed don‚Äôt exist and to either train someone or to have someone with the training costs significantly more than other places. 

Tim said years ago that China wasn‚Äôt for cheap labor but a significant amount of the right skilled labor in a densely populated area. 

It will take decades if not longer and prices will skyrocket."
2025-02-21T18:03:03Z,... and by skilled labor he meant people from the countryside willing to come to the city and learn their particular assembly steps while living in a dormitory at the factory.
2025-02-21T18:26:04Z,"It's not just the technicians and assembly line workers. China has over [1.5M](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/chinas-engineering-capabilities-workforce-2024-munkholm-Â≠üÂèØÂíå-fxrnf/) manufacturing/industrial engineers, or more than [6 times](https://www.zippia.com/manufacturing-engineer-jobs/demographics/#) the amount employed in the US. There's a huge amount of engineers in China who are genuinely incredibly capable.

I work in electronics manufacturing, and it's mind-boggling how much more efficient and streamlined it is working in Chinese facilities compared to US (or anywhere else really).

We had a minor emergency that required a quick turn around on some components we would need for testing. We got quotes from several companies, including US, EU, and Chinese. Both the US and EU companies quoted us at least 4 weeks to even just make the parts. The Chinese company had a 2 day turn around time, and gave us direct access to their engineers who could tune and customize the parts with a 24 hour turn around. Additionally, the Chinese company happened to be located less than 30 minutes away from our production facility which made installation much easier, whereas our EU and US options would have had to ship the parts and go through customs, adding additional delay. 

The US can pour money into its own manufacturing industries, but it will take decades to build the technical expertise, production capabilities, and economies of scale that China now has."
2025-02-21T18:36:41Z,"Yep. We used to have this pre-80‚Äôs, but most of that is gone now with a few exceptions. That‚Äôs outsourcing for you."
2025-02-23T04:19:56Z,I don't think the technical aspect is the issue people point out. It's usually the living and working conditions of workers no?
2025-02-22T09:39:44Z,Also to add it could be a cultural difference between the west and the east.
2025-02-21T18:16:01Z,And Americans make way too much to even think about doing that.
2025-02-21T18:29:38Z,Maybe enough Americans are finally getting poor enough that some previously outsourced production work can start coming back to America.
2025-02-21T18:30:18Z,"Real wages continue to go up. I don‚Äôt know where this Americans are poor myth comes from, but it isn‚Äôt true."
2025-02-21T18:45:29Z,"I was being tongue-in-cheek about what could result in manufacturing coming back to America.

The poor ‚Äúmyth‚Äù also is not a myth for those who measure themselves in the context of living and raising a family in a detached single family home of a suburb in a coastal (or Denver) US city within 45min of an airport.

National statistics might indicate people are doing just as well or even better than before, but people feel like others are pulling ahead (which they are), and that is what makes them feel rich or poor.

Also, people know that price increases in things like healthcare, education, and land put certain goals completely out of reach, and that also makes them feel poor. ¬†They might expect to receive cutting edge healthcare, which is way better than before, but they don‚Äôt expect it to cost them more than before.

Kind of like seeing Home Alone and Home Improvement and Friends and stuff as kids and expecting you can live that lifestyle, when it was always a depiction of top 10% life."

2025-02-21T18:00:30Z,"The alternative is to invest a bunch of money automating the tasks performed by human labor (skilled or unskilled). Previously, it hasn‚Äôt made financial sense to do that, but Apple‚Äôs math on that may be changing."
2025-02-21T18:19:11Z,This will most likely be the outcome. Or they‚Äôll use the auto industry standards and use machines and humans for quality control/assisting.

Apple Wallet sync is temporarily disabled till I find a way to test it (no Apple Card in India means no way to test it). I have posted about it over at Apple developer forums: [https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/773474](https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/773474)

I am in touch with some folks at Apple and hopefully they'll help me figure out the FinanceKit issue."
2025-02-23T18:33:03Z,To be clear I am using pdf imports right now
2025-02-23T18:38:01Z,"PDF import should work in most cases. The freeze issue is specific to Apple Wallet sync though, so deleting that account and manually creating a new one should work for PDF imports. Let me know if it's freezing even for non-Apple wallet accounts."
2025-02-23T18:39:09Z,Maybe it‚Äôs the name? Because I only ever used pdf imports for the account
2025-02-23T18:44:30Z,"It‚Äôs possible, I‚Äôd recommend deleting the account and re-creating it with a different name (like AppleCard or something) + importing PDF again. If it still freezes, please email me the card statement if possible."
2025-02-23T18:50:08Z,Created a new account named C1 travel and before adding any transactions the same issue occurs with editing account
2025-02-23T17:11:10Z,Congrats! Will check it out.
2025-02-23T17:46:39Z,Thanks brother!
2025-02-23T17:36:06Z,"The app is really beautiful and well made, closest I've found to what I was looking for. The only issue was no camera scanning of receipts, which is unfortunately a deal breaker for me. I've activated premium because it said ""camera scanner"" as a feature but I didn't find it in the ""+"" button? Anyways if you add automatic expense adding with an in-app camera feature that would amazing because I really want to love this app."
2025-02-23T17:46:21Z,The camera scanning should become visible for premium users. Can you try restarting the app?
2025-02-23T17:54:58Z,"Doesn‚Äôt appear to me, is it supposed to be here?

2025-02-23T18:14:33Z,"Yes it's supposed to be here. Are you sure premium is activated? Sometimes it doesn't get activated, open the Settings screen in Finma, if you see the subscribe option on top it means the sub activation failed. Simply tap Learn More &gt; scroll to bottom and hit Restore Purchase."
2025-02-23T18:46:55Z,"Yes I‚Äôm sure premium is activated, I dont see the subscribe option at the top of the app‚Äôs settings, and i‚Äôve even checked the iPhone subscription settings and yes it‚Äôs there."
2025-02-23T19:58:23Z,Suggestion: Add ‚ÄúAdd a category‚Äù button inside the transaction category selection screen. It‚Äôs great that you can do it from the settings screen but kind of a pain when you are in the middle of tagging a transaction.
2025-02-24T02:45:35Z,Makes sense. Will add one!
2025-02-24T11:47:27Z,"Hello Tanmay,

Interesting application. Saw it recommended over by the folks at 9to5Mac so thought I‚Äôd give it a shot. I see in the comments they there is suppose to be a receipt scanner in Finma which makes this interesting for me along with your statements about privacy.

One feature I‚Äôm looking for is the ability to create an expense report for business expenses in order to submit for reimbursement. I was wondering if something like that would be on the roadmap for Finma? Something to categorize certain transactions as business expense and compile the list and associated receipts, scanned and PDF, into a report for submission."
2025-02-24T14:57:41Z,"Gave it a download, I have not been able to use the PDF importer, none have worked and it did request I send an email which I have done, I do however have a lot of my transactions in industry standard formats, would be useful if I could just import through those also such as .ofx"
2025-02-24T17:00:14Z,"I‚Äôm going to work on adding csv import. Will research about ofx, I haven‚Äôt heard about it yet."
2025-02-23T16:15:34Z,Hey! Downloading now and will give it a shot.
2025-02-23T16:21:10Z,Thank you! Looking forward to it!
2025-02-23T18:15:31Z,Finma balls
2025-02-21T16:58:13Z,Why would it be? It‚Äôs not included to cut costs. Don‚Äôt have to be a genius to work that out.
2025-02-21T19:15:44Z,"The magnets cost nothing. The chassis and all of their machines are already made to include them. 

Magsafe is a very calculated omission designed to upsell by removing convenience to create dissatisfaction without looking like they're cheaping out on vital components like the screen, camera, or processor.

They want it look like a great deal based on the specs sheet while subtly pushing people away from it in a way that doesn't explicitly devalue it."
2025-02-22T03:54:22Z,Similar story to the mini line of phones. ¬†Self sabotage of a product¬†
2025-02-23T17:30:15Z,"Agree that it is a calculated omission, hard disagree on ""the magnets cost nothing."" The parts have cost as do their assembly. And there's great value in reducing the parts count. 

There are many ways they do not cost nothing: omitting things like this is how you get a low cost phone."
2025-02-21T23:28:59Z,What a stupid decision. Make a phone that no one wants to buy. If they're going to do that they could've at least gave us a Mini instead. The Mini fulfills a niche and this doesn't.
2025-02-22T08:54:41Z,"&gt; Make a phone that no one wants to buy.

You're putting a lot of stock into how much customers value MagSafe

As much as I love the feature, I'm literally the only iPhone user that I've ever seen use it"
2025-02-22T09:24:24Z,"Reddit is an echo chamber after all.
I went to my grandparents house for a reunion and talk to them about how my lightning port is broken and have to use MagSafe, no one know what MagSafe is so I had to explain what it is."
2025-02-22T16:45:47Z,"They probably gather data on how much people use different features. My guess is Pro users use MagSafe more than non-Pro users, so they decided they could save some nominal amount (probably less than $5) per phone by leaving it out.

$5 x 100,000 handsets sold = a cool half a mil.

This is totally guessing with made-up numbers, but it seems likely to me that it‚Äôs something like this."
2025-02-22T09:37:11Z,"Yeah unless Apple run TV ads about a product/service/feature, the overwhelming majority of the general public tend to remain clueless about it"
2025-02-22T17:45:14Z,"I'm a big Apple fan, used Macs since 2007, iPhones since the 3G release, and I have had a 12 Pro Max and currently 15 Pro Max, I've never used a single MagSafe accessory. Nor do I know anyone that does. I don't think this is as big of a deal as people are making it out to be."
2025-02-22T17:56:55Z,"Don‚Äôt get me wrong I use it all the time and I‚Äôve got various unlicensed MagSafe accessories but I know I‚Äôm in the minority

I even ran an ecom store selling MagSafe products and there was no market for them"
2025-02-23T09:00:55Z,"I was planning to buy 16e until I read it didn‚Äôt have MagSafe - is a deal breaker for me, my bedside charger and car mounts all require it‚Ä¶"
2025-02-22T15:58:19Z,I think you underestimate the amount of people that are just going to buy the cheapest iPhone available when they get cell service.  If people want any ‚Äúhigher end‚Äù features they have to pay for it
2025-02-23T02:05:56Z,"It‚Äôs an iPhone with a cheaper price tag, will honestly be a fine product given it‚Äôs cheaper not everyone needs 2 cameras and MagSafe.

Lots of people don‚Äôt even know flagship iPhones have magnets, lets alone charge with them."
2025-02-22T11:08:45Z,"It's not intended to cut cost

It's for product segregation. To give people a reason to spend more on the $799 iPhone 16

The iPhone 16 is now a product with 3 equipment levels, like the same car can come with 3 trim levels.

* 16e - base model
* 16 - mid-level
* 16 Pro - top specification

And just like you don't get heated leather massage seats in the base model of a car, you don't get MagSafe in the iPhone 16e.

You want the fancy features? You have to pay more for a better spec model.

It has NOTHING to do with how much it costs Apple to put that feature in any specific phone."
2025-02-21T17:01:43Z,"The lack of U2 chip is what‚Äôs really baffling to me. Lack of MagSafe I can understand for cost-cutting measures, magnets add significant cost. But the ultra wide band SHOULD be standard across the whole lineup!"
2025-02-21T17:10:16Z,"¬´Significant¬ª‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a phone that starts at 599. 

I think the answer is much closer to ¬´what can we remove so there‚Äôs a big enough gap to the regular 16?¬ª. 

It‚Äôs important for Apple to make you want to upgrade to the next tier and the next. 

As MKBHD puts it: https://youtube.com/shorts/NiNYOZZLOyg"
2025-02-21T18:06:57Z,Business 101. You have tiered products to cast the widest net. The bottom tier should really be for the people who can barely afford that as it makes it seem the ability to attain a status symbol is easy and a majority should be holding your mid tier.
2025-02-21T19:31:49Z,It's the Cadillac Cimeron of phones.
2025-02-21T21:09:02Z,Yeah except that the U2 chip encourages further sales of Apple products like AirTags and other find my enables things. There‚Äôs a benefit to having all your devices support a technology that channels users into buying more from you. Seems penny wise pound foolish to me.¬†
2025-02-21T22:10:32Z,"&gt; Seems penny wise pound foolish to me. 

As the entry level phone, this phone exists to get people in the door and move them up to more expesnive phones. Like you suggested, that U2 chip is really useful to people, so that's a good motivator for them to buy a more expensive phone knowing they'll be missing out if they buy this phone."
2025-02-21T22:19:22Z,"Yes but the entry level person won‚Äôt know they want it until they try out an air tag or two. They have no idea what the U2 chip is but when they see their friend or whatever using the seeking ability they will be disappointed they can‚Äôt do it too. ¬†You want to reduce barriers to entering your full ecosystem as much as possible. Once you‚Äôre in the ecosystem, much more likely you will stay there and upgrade to the more expensive phone next time.¬†"
2025-02-21T23:49:20Z,I think they have enough data to know what‚Äôs making these tier of users budge. Majority of these users still don‚Äôt and/or won‚Äôt use it or it‚Äôs the company phone that doesn‚Äôt need that.
2025-02-21T23:51:58Z,Pretty lazy argument. ‚ÄúApple did it therefore it must be right.‚Äù
2025-02-22T09:38:36Z,"I like that you think you know more about marketing and selling iPhones than one of the most valuable companies on earth who makes most of their money from marketing and selling‚Ä¶ iPhones.

It‚Äôs cute how dunning and Kruger made their hypothesis so visible."
2025-02-22T22:52:40Z,"How are you supposed to motivate people to buy into the brands ecosystem when you lock them out of the ecosystem?

If anything that person is going to buy this thinking it‚Äôll work, because Apple marketing says  their products are the most cohesive on the planet, and find out they were lied to which is going to upset them and drive them away from Apple."
2025-02-22T00:36:27Z,There have been rumors of a ultrawide band based AirPods instead of BT that would potentially be much better. This phone kinda pours hot water on that since they would likely want to support a lot of iPhones.
2025-02-21T18:10:56Z,"It‚Äôs the Nvidia strategy.

Many different options priced close enough to make you want to upgrade to the next tier, and all of them are terrible value."
2025-02-21T22:14:21Z,Yeah it‚Äôs just exists to get people to step up to the normal 16/17 whatever
2025-02-21T17:42:09Z,The 13 mini started at the same price no?
2025-02-21T19:20:07Z,That was a full flagship phone but mini (iirc). This is a worse phone in comparison to the 16.
2025-02-22T23:00:01Z,Correct. The Mini was an iPhone 12/13 but in a smaller package. All of the internal hardware was exactly the same except for the physically smaller battery.
2025-02-21T22:34:48Z,Could be related to the end of (PRODUCT) RED. Bono is so mad that they decided not to supply U2 chips to Apple anymore
2025-02-21T20:54:41Z,"I agree with you on the U2 chip omission being weird, it makes it less likely that anyone with a 16e will buy AirTags / AirPods etc and lessens the local find-my-friend feature for everyone since if one person has an iPhone 16e you won‚Äôt be able to track them.

MagSafe also makes it less likely they‚Äôll buy certain accessories, but doesn‚Äôt impact the ecosystem as much."
2025-02-21T17:33:38Z,Pretty sure magnets are cheaper than a chip... I imagine magnets are quite large and take up space which means needing smaller components for packaging but that's just a guess.
2025-02-21T21:21:33Z,Magnets are actually quite expensive and many chips are rather cheap.
2025-02-21T22:33:12Z,"I said this in other words and got blasted to hell with people saying ""it's not implemented enough blah blah"". 

This thing should cost $100 less base minimum."
2025-02-22T03:36:29Z,"Bought an AirTag? Sorry you cannot locate it. It doesn't even have U1, not to mention U2. No MagSafe is also baffling. They also used a cheap 48MP sensor for the camera so the marketing talk about how good the camera is just to make it look like you are getting a lot of value"
2025-02-21T22:34:44Z,"Yeah , significant cost , about $4 on AliExpress"
2025-02-21T18:54:47Z,"&gt;magnets add significant cost

This is factually and categorically wrong. Magnets are cheap af as evidences that you can buy 5 lbs of small magnets for mere dollars from Amazon or AliE."
2025-02-22T03:19:23Z,"Strong neodymium magnets are not cheap, and people getting the 16e are probably upgrading from another phone without MagSafe, so they won't be giving up any existing accessories."
2025-02-22T06:05:37Z,Lmao magnets significant cost? Go look at magnetic rings on aliexpress then reduce it even more at apples volume not to mention they have the rings for other phones already being made
2025-02-21T20:02:03Z,"If a customer buys 1 MagSafe accessory from Apple during the lifetime of their phone, it will more than pay for the magnet. Really bizarre not to include it."
2025-02-21T17:07:23Z,"I‚Äôd say less to cut costs and more to keep some features to the more expensive phones.

Though I guess it‚Äôs two birds with one stone."
2025-02-21T17:37:45Z,"Yes this. They have to both maintain their customary margins, and make sure no one who can afford a better model will be tempted."
2025-02-22T01:51:58Z,"How much would it cost to add the MagSafe magnets though? And they increased the price anyway. Even without the high speed charging, the magnets would keep compatibility with all the non-charging MagSafe accessories that Apple has been pushing for years now."
2025-02-22T08:32:07Z,A journalist needed to write a story.
2025-02-22T15:59:49Z,"Yeah, a Trillion dollar company need to cut costs on a fucking magnets..."
2025-02-22T16:19:02Z,"They don't even need to add magnets to the phone, they could have just sold cases with magnets. But not even Qi2 speeds is wild"
2025-02-21T22:22:29Z,"That or they just looked at it, realized nobody was using Magsafe and that it wasn't worth the cost of including."
2025-02-21T17:04:53Z,"everyone does feature separation like this to keep the cheap products cheap and protect the more profitable ones. enterprise IT has been doing for 20 years. i've seen fiber switches sold for $5000 that were the same hardware as the $30,000 models and the rest was software licensing you could pay for"
2025-02-21T23:23:38Z,This also allows them to add MagSafe to the 17e.  It's a way of slow rolling out the features so the next model is more attractive.
2025-02-23T23:03:28Z,"Which, in my opinion would even dumber - people who went with the SE type devices keep them for much longer. My 68 year old aunt still has her SE 2 and probably will just hold onto it until my cousin gets her a new one once it‚Äôs dropped from iOS upgrades or she complains the new battery doesn‚Äôt last long enough."
2025-02-24T04:32:15Z,"I sorta agree, but at any given time a lot of people need a new phone.¬†"
2025-02-22T15:12:28Z,"There‚Äôs a difference between that and just not putting in something you already had forever

Like if MagSafe just came out, I‚Äôd be cool with it, but it didn‚Äôt and they let Android have it with the newest Qi charging. 

If they really wanted to save money they could‚Äôve used the body of the Mini, and done all this experimenting there. With how shit the US economy is about to be, this product is going to *flop*. I‚Äôm honestly looking to upgrade now before I got to college because I don‚Äôt want to buy a new phone until I start working a good job afterwards, but Android or the used market is looking more appealing than the *budget* option they had.

I feel like Apple is backtracking their pro consumer stances and going back to being the greedy PoS they were before. I was looking to pay the base amount for upgrading the storage, not to just have the phone. If ‚Äú16E‚Äù means this is every year, then they just ruined the market they had with the SE"
2025-02-21T21:54:55Z,Easy: this device is an upgrade path for those who had the previous SE and shouldn‚Äôt be an upgrade path for those who have devices with MagSafe
2025-02-22T07:21:57Z,"This logic does not really work. The first iphone to have a magsafe is iphone 12. So there are a number of generations between that and this one and all of them are in the same price range, except the se. 

Also, the se is the most different when it comes to form factor. It is small and has a home button, targeting a specific demographic. But this one does not seem to have a market in mind. $600 is a lot for the significant downgrades from iphone 15 and 16."
2025-02-22T15:19:08Z,"This also isn‚Äôt the SE anymore but the 16E

If the 16 has MagSafe, a feature that‚Äôs been around for a while now, its less expensive option should still have it. The only thing this has in common with the 16 is just the name and screen size. It was legit just an excuse to charge more for it, there‚Äôs no defending the 16E until we see how the market responds to it because to us so far, we know this thing definitely isn‚Äôt worth 600 fucking dollars.

I was looking at getting an SE because I don‚Äôt need a big phone and want to downsize to something I can rely on for years. But I know this switch to AI is already going to screw older phones later on, and now they don‚Äôt even have the SE anymore, that phone and market has been killed for whatever one they‚Äôre trying to grab with the 16E"
2025-02-21T18:33:17Z,"A positive is removal of MagSafe allows people with pacemakers to use iPhones hassle free. I saw a top comment on another phone (that lacked magnetic charging) mention their grandparents are unable to use iPhones anymore due to MagSafe. The reason is because Apple recommends keeping the MagSafe 12 inches away at all times which isn‚Äôt always possible.

You can still use MagSafe using a MagSafe case, though the reduced charged speeds of the lower spec is about half."
2025-02-22T02:56:29Z,"The decision is hardly a mystery‚Ä¶ Apple has research up the wazoo about the people who purchase these iPhones, and that research is obviously telling them that the amount of people who care about a feature like MagSafe isn‚Äôt high enough to warrant including it in this version of iPhone. Whether it has it or not will likely result in negligible sales volume variations, so they ship it without it to make more money."
2025-02-22T20:29:53Z,Yeah. My family has no idea about tech and most of them just want the newest iPhone. So the cheapest 16 series iPhone it is.. haha
2025-02-21T17:26:48Z,"Did Apple ever said that MagSafe was removed because of their new modem?

Sounds like non-news.

They just didn‚Äôt feel like MagSafe was needed for 16e."
2025-02-21T17:35:45Z,"Pretty much. The SE didn‚Äôt have it, the 16e doesn‚Äôt have it and, wild prediction, the 17e, if there IS such a thing, won‚Äôt have it."
2025-02-22T11:23:26Z,Can‚Äôt you just buy a MagSafe case for the 16e if you wanted MagSafe?
2025-02-22T22:52:31Z,It‚Äôs not the same.
2025-02-23T06:48:11Z,"Ish, I used a MagSafe case on an 11 and it worked pretty well."
2025-02-23T07:18:43Z,So you get full speed MagSafe charging?
2025-02-23T07:22:28Z,"I don‚Äôt remember the speed, but it worked pretty well.  I could slap the portable charger on and it held. That‚Äôs all I really wanted it for."
2025-02-23T10:47:56Z,"No you won‚Äôt, but it‚Äôs only for night time charging really‚Ä¶."
2025-02-22T18:38:11Z,"It‚Äôs missing due to Apple new exciting gift to its customers, been doing since the Tim Cook era


- remove the power adapter, raise the price

- remove the wired headphones, raise the price

- remove the stickers, raise the price

- keep 5GB of ‚Äúfree storage‚Äù for a decade, raise the price 

- remove the MagSafe, raise the price"
2025-02-21T21:01:42Z,Most of the SE/E phones are not sold to consumers. They are sold to corporations as enterprise devices. Enterprise buys whatever the lowest cost model is. They don't care what features are in it.
2025-02-22T05:28:57Z,"Can confirm. As a gov employee, we‚Äôre all issued SE‚Äôs"
2025-02-22T15:35:00Z,"I work in corporate IT. They were all using iPhone 7s until a couple of years ago when they switched the entire company at once to SEs. Thousands of phones in one week.

Pretty much how it works across corporate America."
2025-02-22T23:12:57Z,"Unless you‚Äôre my company and you just buy whatever is available.

Of the iPhones we run (we also run andoirds, you can request one over the other), you can get anywhere from a SE to a 13 pro. All depends on what they actually have available at the time you take your position. I don‚Äôt get it either."

2025-02-23T16:04:42Z,"If you use a wallet case, magsafe is an inconvenience.  If you travel its also another largish thing to stuff in a minimalist bag."
2025-02-23T22:59:23Z,"Certainly is an odd ‚Äúcripple‚Äù for the 16e, then."
2025-02-21T18:16:34Z,Apple is really set on becoming Samsung. I don‚Äôt know why they‚Äôre so determined to just completely fragment the iPhone across so many SKU‚Äôs and feature sets that there‚Äôs no more cohesion at all.
2025-02-21T18:30:51Z,"Meh.  It's no more fragmented now than it was.

Every year they knock one of the older phones off their store.

For a while now they've had an SE (now an E) variant that's sufficiently different than the other mainstream models.  The most recent SE model also lacked the magnet charging, just like this one. 

They knocked off the last of their Lightning models with this change, to satisfy the EU decree.  They added a new ""cheaper"" variant that will probably remain for another 3 years like the older SE models."
2025-02-21T17:01:30Z,"So it was greed, gotcha."
2025-02-23T06:53:00Z,"It‚Äôs exactly what it is.  Imagine being so insecure about your Apple product you have to downvote a true criticism.  Apple is full of greed.  I like their product, still a greedy company"
2025-02-21T18:21:53Z,"Do you put in 100% in everything you do even if it‚Äôs not needed and might be a waste? Oh, I see."

2025-02-21T20:21:38Z,That was the joke.
2025-02-21T17:34:11Z,Apple should have known that there would be people that assumed that‚Äôs the location and size of the actual C1 chip in the 16e. :)

2025-02-21T20:16:28Z,You'd rather have a worse screen or less memory than..... wireless charging? a feature many people don't even use? (and ig some accessories but ive never seen any that are that appealing)
2025-02-22T08:30:03Z,"I buy phones for staff. A cost effective, well featured iPhone would be helpful. If it‚Äôs lacking what in 2025 are basic features needed in a business use phone, why? (MagSafe, U2). I suppose I‚Äôll need to buy more expensive models but not upgrade them as often.

Seems like a good way to p**s off a  dedicated Apple buyers.üò°.

Edit: downvoted because business case. Apologies: seems business is not the focus of this product."
2025-02-23T03:49:54Z,What specific business purpose is in need of MagSafe?
2025-02-23T13:32:42Z,AI motivational quotes‚Ä¶ no offense OP but I think we‚Äôre nearing the bottom
2025-02-23T13:57:05Z,"The AI part is elaborating on the quoted, as an explanation.¬†"
2025-02-23T18:17:48Z,"Hi, AI provides context about quotes and author. Quotes aren‚Äôt generated by AI. You see app preview video on the product page."
2025-02-22T00:18:35Z,"Ô£øVision Pro is *so cool*, but right now it‚Äôs just floating iPad apps that don‚Äôt actually interpret and interact with the world around them. Until they do, AR is just a gimmick."
2025-02-22T06:44:01Z,"The Vision Pro is functionally similar to an iPad so makes sense.

It‚Äôs definitely a cool device. Great even for its category but Jesus fucking Christ it‚Äôs nearly useless on its own.

And everytime I see similar critiques being made the response is always ‚Äúbut it‚Äôs great when connected to a Mac‚Äù. Well no shit. That‚Äôs because you can barely do most productive tasks if at all on visionOS alone. So you‚Äôre *forced* to connect it to what is objectively a better device in everything but watching movies I guess?

I see the long term potential and I‚Äôm trying to be optimistic, but I also thought the same when Apple made the iPadOS split hoping iPads could truly be great standalone computers too. Years later and I still have to use a Mac for most of my productivity and my iPad is mostly used for streaming, taking notes, and a second monitor via Sidecar."
2025-02-22T14:18:22Z,"I tried one out, I was blown away. It‚Äôs genuinely brilliant, and I‚Äôm a tech developer who has always been interested in augmented reality.

But‚Ä¶. ¬£3500 for a 1.0 device‚Ä¶.. umm‚Ä¶ no.

I hope it isn‚Äôt canned as I‚Äôd love to what an M5 powered version is capable of."
2025-02-22T21:55:00Z,"yeah it doesn‚Äôt help that apple didn‚Äôt make a handful of their own first party apps the de facto standard for what a visionOS app should be like, why should 3rd party devs?"
2025-02-21T21:40:06Z,"&gt;When Apple revealed the Vision Pro in 2023, it called the $3,500 headset its next ‚Äúmajor platform.‚Äù Two years later, and a year after going on sale, the device is thin on apps. 

&gt;Apple doesn‚Äôt regularly release stats on the number of Vision Pro apps that are available, and it‚Äôs hard to tell how many new apps come out in any given month. According to consultancy AppFigures, which tracks Apple‚Äôs platforms, the number of new Vision Pro apps has declined every month since the device hit the market in February 2024.

&gt;When Apple unveiled the Vision Pro, executives said that developers would be able to create new experiences that weren‚Äôt possible with traditional computers. But so far, top developers remain mostly focused elsewhere, and major tech companies like Google, Meta and Netflix have yet to release their most important apps for the headset.

&gt;Many of the new apps and ideas for the Vision Pro are coming from independent developers, hacking on the weekends while holding down day jobs. 

&gt;One person in the indie camp is Adam Roszyk, a programmer in Poland who has created 17 Vision Pro apps since the headset was first released.

&gt;For $4, Roszyk‚Äôs Night Vision app lets a Vision Pro user tap the depth-sensing cameras of the device to see objects in the dark. If you spend $5, you can perform a chore in a Luigi‚Äôs Mansion-like video game using the app Vacuume, which overlays virtual coins on your floor that you can vacuum up, along with any real dirt or dust. And for $6, Roszyk‚Äôs app Scan Export lets users create a 3D digital scan of an entire building just by walking around, a useful tool for those in construction or real estate. 

&gt;‚ÄúWe are still early, and we don‚Äôt really know how it can be really useful in your life,‚Äù Roszyk said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs so many different ideas that just come to your mind.‚Äù

&gt;Roszyk continues to work on Vision Pro apps because he said he believes ‚Äúspatial computing‚Äù ‚Äî Apple‚Äôs preferred terminology for headset and glasses technology that can integrate 3D objects with the world around them ‚Äî will be the next big platform. Roszyk is betting that developing apps now can put him in prime position when more people are walking around with a Vision Pro or, perhaps some day, lightweight glasses. 

&gt;‚ÄúThis type of computing is the future,‚Äù Roszyk said. ‚ÄúI would definitely compare it to the first iPhones.‚Äù

&gt;Roszyk‚Äôs efforts have made him money, but not enough for Vision Pro development to become his full-time job. His 17 apps have cleared about $4,000 on the App Store in the last three months. That number is growing as he releases more apps and more people find out about them, Roszyk said. 

&gt;Apple updated its most recent Vision Pro app count in August, with CEO Tim Cook telling investors on an earnings call that the platform had 2,500 apps. That number covers fully immersive apps that overlay virtual objects over the real world as well as 2D apps with some spatial components.

&gt;By AppFigures‚Äô count, less than 1,900 of these apps remained active at the end of January.

&gt;There are also about 1.5 million Vision Pro apps that are ported versions of iPhone and iPad apps. Apple automatically ports iPhone and iPad apps to the Vision Pro when they‚Äôre uploaded, but companies can decline. Those apps can be used inside the headset but appear as 2D flat screens. Meta started to emulate that strategy last year with 2D Android apps for Quest, but the company doesn‚Äôt have the same library of millions of existing mobile apps.

&gt;Apple doesn‚Äôt publish Vision Pro sales, but one estimate from IDC suggests fewer than 1 million devices have been sold.

&gt;Some services like Netflix and YouTube, and game streaming services like Nvidia GeForce Now can be accessed through the Apple Vision Pro‚Äôs browser. And existing apps often receive updates that introduce a spatial mode, such as the NBA scores app, which recently got an experimental feature that allows users to watch a live basketball game as if the players were miniature figurines on a table.

&gt;Apple Arcade, a monthly game subscription from Apple, does require that its titles support the Vision Pro in addition to iPhones and iPads. Apple Arcade developers are paid by Apple and their apps are free to subscribers.

&gt;Although many of those games are 2D, some are exclusive to the Vision Pro. In January, Apple released Gears &amp; Goo, a Vision Pro app that enables the player to control an army of goofy frog-like characters on a table in the real world.

&gt;The Vision Pro app gold rush has seen slower uptake than the iPhone‚Äôs app boom. 

&gt;A year after the iPhone App Store was launched in 2008, Apple was crowing about the platform having 50 million customers, 2 billion downloads and 85,000 apps. Apple regularly told investors and developers how much money it had paid from App Store sales ‚Äî it hasn‚Äôt released any similar stat for the Vision Pro.

&gt;Many in the VR industry hoped Apple‚Äôs entry would kick off a boom like the iPhone did for mobile apps, creating fortunes as millions of users sought to fill their new devices with fresh software.

&gt;‚ÄúMy assumption back then was whatever Apple releases might be in that final form, so it‚Äôs a good idea to be ready as early as possible,‚Äù said Nikhil Jacob, who runs Reality Uni, which publishes content about developing apps for the Vision Pro. ‚ÄúBut my assumption there ended up being wrong.‚Äù

&gt;Jacob said he believes that an app developer ecosystem for the Vision Pro will take a lot longer to build out than it did for the iPhone because key pieces are missing. Jacob hopes Apple improves the Vision Pro app store to help users find new apps.

&gt;The slow uptake, due largely to the high price tag, has led some to worry that VR and its related technologies are once again entering a lull.

&gt;‚ÄúWinter has come,‚Äù said Jarrett Webb, who develops headset apps for Argodesign, a software consultancy. ‚ÄúEven Apple couldn‚Äôt produce a winner.‚Äù

&gt;Still, some optimism remains among Vision Pro developers. 

&gt;They say that Apple‚Äôs hardware is solid, the company‚Äôs developer tools are improving, and that the Vision Pro lays the groundwork for future software and hardware updates. It also helps that Vision Pro owners still seem to be excited to try out new apps.

&gt;Apple‚Äôs entry into the headset market, combined with Google‚Äôs recent announcement of its own Android XR platform, as well as Meta‚Äôs billions of dollars of investment signals that there will be a market for VR content, said John Gearty, who worked on the Vision Pro at Apple and is the founder of PulseJet Studios, a VR production house focusing on music. Gearty is hoping for steady growth from the market, but he has tempered his expectations. 

&gt;Apple has not said if it will update the Vision Pro. According to analysts, the company is working on a successor. Developers want it to be lighter and less expensive. They welcome any improvements that would get it on more faces.

&gt;‚ÄúOver time, everything gets better, and it too will have its course of getting better and better,‚Äù Cook told The Wall Street Journal in October. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs just arguably a success today from an ecosystem-being-built-out point of view.‚Äù"
2025-02-22T01:49:56Z,"That's a lot of words to say ""not even the nerds who write all our apps want this device"""
2025-02-22T05:34:27Z,I want one but can't afford it. I quit my job to go all in on iOS &amp; macOS app dev. It's starting to work out for me but the up front cost of doing visionOS is terrible!
2025-02-24T16:39:47Z,Dude seems to be all in on the Vision Pro and his 17 apps have made him basically enough money to pay for his Vision Pro. That‚Äôs depressing.
2025-02-21T22:52:50Z,"For me I just don't see the appeal of VR right now however I feel like there are some killer applications in sports broadcasting with full 360 degree views. 

Give me an MLB broadcast where I can 'sit' in various places on the field like behind the catcher, in the dugout, first/third base coaching box, etc. 

Or let me 'stand' behind a kicker during a field goal attempt. 

Or let me 'sit' in an F1 car or during a NASCAR race"
2025-02-22T02:52:29Z,"It‚Äôs not vr but a bar in Los Angeles kinda already does this, I would imagine the same or similar setup could be used for vr though.

2025-02-22T04:10:59Z,I want to visit this bar.
2025-02-22T16:39:12Z,Seats cost almost a much as going to the live event.
2025-02-22T07:57:23Z,I‚Äôm not a sports guy at all but when I watched the demo showing off the ‚Äúyou‚Äôre watching the game at hoop/goal/field‚Äù level I definitely saw myself as one who would watch a game like that. I haven‚Äôt really seen too much take advantage of this full force though
2025-02-23T01:45:30Z,And for concerts!!
2025-02-22T18:31:08Z,This is what Apple has to lean on. If this became a standard for sports I‚Äôd much be better incentivized to invest in this
2025-02-22T22:19:38Z,"I‚Äôm sure there are licensing + bandwidth hurdles to get through when it comes to sports casting in VR but man, if they can get it figured out I could see sports entertainment really being a huge driving factor in VR sales. The sports section of the Vision Pro demo had my jaw on the floor.

I‚Äôve got a Quest 3 and have tried Xtadium for some NBA games and while it‚Äôs cool, it still has a ways to go."
2025-02-23T02:09:25Z,"I get the sentiment on it but sports is a very communal thing and is pretty contraindicated by this. You‚Äôre either there or you aren‚Äôt, and you don‚Äôt want to be isolated in a virtual world either way."
2025-02-23T02:06:48Z,The problem with that for me and probably a lot of people is that sounds fucking nauseating. I legitimately think Apple needs to somehow solve motion sickness for this product to succeed. I felt the same with oculus. Most of us old people get all fucked up from this stuff.
2025-02-24T03:42:56Z,This feature alone would justify purchase for many. Unfortunately I get the feeling that it is many years away
2025-02-22T03:05:23Z,Yeah anything you have to wear on your face is a gimmick. I don‚Äôt see any sort of headwear becoming an everyday device for most people unless they already wear glasses
2025-02-22T11:11:18Z,"Soooooo
Just about 4 billion people on the globe then?"
2025-02-22T12:31:07Z,"OK but that's part of the reason why Vision Pro isn't doing so hot. For 4 billion of us, this device literally cannot be used without adding in custom lenses. Once that's done, it's a device that only I can use and sharing it with others just isn't possible.

The tech is amazing, but VR is absolutely just as much of a gimmick now as it was decades ago when the concept was first introduced. Apple hasn't changed anything about that. They have no idea what the killer app is, and neither does anyone else."
2025-02-22T03:30:26Z,There‚Äôs no apps because there‚Äôs not a big user base. There‚Äôs not a big user base because it‚Äôs too expensive. It‚Äôs too expensive because it‚Äôs over engineered. It‚Äôs over engineered because this tech simply isn‚Äôt ready for common mainstream use.
2025-02-22T19:36:31Z,"The problem is that it's an iPad that is priced like a top end MacBookPro. 

That would be enough if Apple had delivered on its previous paradigm shift failure: tablet as the next gen personal computer. However the iPad is still ""just a large iPhone"" like 15 years ago. If you need anything that cannot be done on your iPhone, an iPad will not do it either, you need a laptop.

That criples ""Spatial Computing"" to be ""just an iPhone VR headset"" and worse, for 99% of what people do with it, the VR aspect is having a movable large 2D screen that give you neck pain and nobody else can see."
2025-02-23T02:10:48Z,"iPad is amazing for writing, but I get your point."
2025-02-22T08:53:28Z,And ordinary users get tired with it on their heads
2025-02-22T16:49:32Z,"There is not a big user base even among the people who‚Äôve bought one. This is the newton, not the ipad.¬†"
2025-02-22T20:04:10Z,It's not just too expensive. It's also too heavy. I tried it at the store and can't imagine it on my head even 30 minutes without taking a break.
2025-02-21T23:27:25Z,I want one but I can‚Äôt justify the price.
2025-02-22T00:00:49Z,Weight is my issue and the lack of being an actual computer.
2025-02-21T21:56:07Z,The Apple Watch also has fuck all apps and does pretty good
2025-02-21T22:08:21Z,"I think the difference is that the Apple Watch is an accessory device. You aren't buying it to play games or do work on, you're buying it to get your notifications, and do some workout tracking. The Vision Pro on the other hand is designed to be a standalone device, with some ability to work with other Apple products (like being virtual displays for Macs)."
2025-02-21T22:25:12Z,"I frequently need to do something on my phone, and with the headset on it‚Äôs very hard to ready my phone‚Äôs screen. If I could mirror it to my Mac and then show that on my Vision Pro it would be better, but as is, the lack of apps is crippling¬†"
2025-02-22T00:15:05Z,"You can AirPlay your iPhone / iPad screens into VP, but you can‚Äôt interact with it except by using the physical device. Not ideal, but a workaround."
2025-02-22T02:49:06Z,I‚Äôve seen that option from my computer but not my phone. Using a 15 pro. Is there a minimum specification for that to work?
2025-02-22T03:50:36Z,"While in VP, initiate Screen Sharing from your phone. Your headset should appear as a receiver."
2025-02-22T04:24:05Z,"I‚Äôm guessing this is one of Apple‚Äôs ‚Äúit just works‚Äù things where if it‚Äôs not there as an option I‚Äôm SOL? Same Apple ID, same network, not showing. I can see Apple tv‚Äôs but no Vision Pro.¬†"
2025-02-22T06:40:07Z,If I remember correctly there‚Äôs an AirPlay receiver toggle you need to turn on in Settings &gt; General somewhere.
2025-02-21T22:08:47Z,"Yeah, because it has an established use. It has killer features as a wearable - namely all the health tracking features. The AVP doesn‚Äôt."
2025-02-22T17:37:38Z,"At launch the Apple Watch suffered from the same apps issue as the AVP. There were only a handful and apps ran on the phone, not the watch and they didn't do anything more than what the iPhone already did. Beyond telling time there wasn't much functional use for several years. Then health metrics were introduced and suddenly it found a footing. Like the watch, the AVP needs to find its footing, killer application."
2025-02-22T03:16:20Z,"The AVP does though, it‚Äôs essentially a personal home theater. And has productivity functions too."
2025-02-21T22:25:43Z,"It‚Äôs also relatively affordable for people who want a smart watch.

I‚Äôd love a vr headset, though can‚Äôt convince my wallet to do so."
2025-02-21T22:30:21Z,"Yeah there‚Äôs like no value added with VR.

My watch tells me I‚Äôve been a good little boy every day. Unbeatable."
2025-02-22T03:03:06Z,"Apple Watch takes several generations to figure out that it should focus on fitness and health monitoring, not a fashion watch or new way to communicate."
2025-02-22T03:16:50Z,It took like one generation to pivot.
2025-02-22T01:42:42Z,"The watch has plenty of apps.

I can track my calories, track my water intake, track my exercise, get directions, check the weather, all on my wrist.

Every time I wished something was easily accessible, it existed.

What exactly are you looking for?"
2025-02-22T03:44:01Z,"A decent mechanical watch is already at least $200-$300, doesn't cost much to go from there to the entry-level Apple watch.

Vision Pro is literally 7x times more expensive than the Quest 3, and the Quest 3 is already struggling even though it has a lot more native + PC VR games/apps."
2025-02-22T18:08:51Z,"&gt; The Quest 3 is struggling 

You sure about that?"
2025-02-22T18:18:26Z,"It is, it is being sold at loss, and the retention rate is horrible. Most just use it for a couple of times and to the closet it goes. I have the Quest 1 and Quest 2, was thinking about getting the Quest 3 with its huge visual upgrade so I did some digging, and there is no app/game that makes me want to upgrade. Meta Reality labs continue to burn more than 10 Billions a year, with zero sight of profitability.

As a social network, Horizon is a joke, VRChat is better but it's still empty af and full of horny teenagers."
2025-02-21T23:02:09Z,Depends on who you ask. There have been posts on r/AppleWatch of people asking what to do with their watch because they have no idea. They simply can‚Äôt find a use for it.
2025-02-22T12:27:03Z,"The Apple Vision Pro is 35 times more expensive than an Apple Watch and has an EXTERNAL battery that lasts 1.5 hours, which is half of the battery life of a 250$ Steam Deck with an x86 (NOT ARM) processor running the OCCT stress test"
2025-02-22T23:35:06Z,35 times more expensive?
2025-02-22T05:27:02Z,Tbf so did the iPhone
2025-02-21T21:41:46Z,"I have a couple ideas for apps and I am an app developer. Send me one and I'll make at least two apps for it. I have a $1000 meta quest pro and I can see the potential for VR, but it sits on the shelf most of the time, so I'm not going to shell out $3500 for something that I don't neeeeed."

2025-02-22T02:39:46Z,I already talk to myself in my head and it sucks.
2025-02-22T05:36:20Z,apple doesn't give us devs access to see the user's environment
2025-02-21T21:58:00Z,"&gt; His 17 apps have cleared about $4,000 on the App Store in the last three months.

That is 17 apps making a buck day on average.  Resonates with what I've seen other devs saying:  there is no money building for this platform. 

Apple is going to have to do so much to change this:

1) get rid of slop devs who think of $5 apps to vacuum luigi's mansion

2) stop attacking and extorting good devs"
2025-02-22T05:36:56Z,"Just a function of them pricing it as an ultra luxury item, meaning there was bound to be a tiny customer base, and no incentive for devs to make the killer app. The IPhone created its own ecosystem by virtue of being at a price point where just about everyone could afford it"
2025-02-22T19:44:02Z,"The original iPhone was very expensive for the time ... but it worked very well as a mobile phone and everyone needed a mobile phone in 2007. It replaced your iPod too, and everyone had an iPod in 2007. 

It was an expensive device that replaced 2 devices you needed AND came with killer feature: the screen and very polished multi-touch control. 

The AVP replaces nothing except works as a crippled iPad. It costs like a MBP and perform discutably better than other VR headset 10 times cheaper."
2025-02-22T09:51:02Z,There‚Äôs no consumer market for single-purpose face-masking computers that big
2025-02-21T21:47:32Z,That has been a VR problem from the start.
2025-02-21T21:40:05Z,That‚Äôs the big problem with a lot of new tech. Cool but not enough usefulness beyond marveling over the coolness.
2025-02-22T01:44:13Z,"It‚Äôs expensive as fuck. People who want to tinker don‚Äôt want to pay $100 a year for an Apple developer account.

To me it‚Äôs really that simple.

I‚Äôm a dev. I‚Äôm not spending $3.5k and another extra $100 a year to develop some apps on the side."
2025-02-22T08:32:10Z,"You don‚Äôt need to pay the Apple developer cost until you want to publish to the App Store.. until then you can tinker, build and even deploy your apps to the device to test it. You just pay at the end."
2025-02-21T22:45:28Z,Not enough people who can afford them.
2025-02-22T15:37:14Z,"I have the AVP and I also have a Quest3.

Between the two, there are several apps I use on the AVP, however the Quest is used for only maybe 2-3 apps, with one in particular being used almost 100% of the time.

The number of apps isn‚Äôt a problem."
2025-02-22T22:56:45Z,Apple does a really awful job getting new apps in front of users. I constantly see the same apps I have downloaded already in the App Store. There should never be an app that installed on device show to you in ye App Store.
2025-02-22T07:16:45Z,You could give every iPhone user one of these for free and still hardly anyone would use it. Most people just can‚Äôt be doing with sticking things on their faces beyond the novelty period of 2 months at most.
2025-02-22T12:12:41Z,It has only ONE problem ‚Äì Price.
2025-02-22T12:37:27Z,"No audience, no reason for developers to make apps for it."
2025-02-22T13:17:26Z,"If only there was a company with lots of money who was invested in the success of the device.......... 

But even if there was, are there any people who could develop such things? Developers if you will.

Sadly there are none...

What a mystery. What a conundrum without solution..."
2025-02-22T13:46:35Z,"It‚Äôs not about there not being enough apps, there are not enough users for app developers to want to make apps.

In addition to correctly develop and test an app. 
The developer needs to buy a Vision Pro and $3500 is a significant investment for a development tool for testing only, the ROI case is a really hard one to make."
2025-02-22T17:32:00Z,They should sponsor VRChat to port their app to their platform
2025-02-22T17:50:49Z,"VR and VR masquerading as AR is just a tough sell, normal people don‚Äôt want expensive devices that further isolate them. If Apple made lenses for normal glasses that showed navigation directions, text messages, etc‚Äîthey might have a killer product; but the technology isn‚Äôt anywhere near there yet."
2025-02-22T19:21:19Z,"Not enough apps sure- but also, almost ZERO content for the device. The immersive content that exists is amazing but you could watch it all in maybe 2 hours. Right now I think content IS the killer app- there just isn't enough of it. Streaming live sports would be incredible on this..."
2025-02-22T20:59:54Z,It‚Äôs because they don‚Äôt invest in developers. ¬†They expect developers to take on all the risk. ¬†And none can. So you are stuck with indie apps on a billion dollar device ¬†
2025-02-23T01:42:52Z,"The SDK for it is way way too restrictive 

Here is what usually happens with a new hardware platform. The company releases it, has no idea how it will actually be used, releases a SDK for it, indie devs tinker with it and come up with spectacular new things to do with it, the huge company that releases the hardware then pretends that was the plan all along and tunes the SDK in that direction

With Apple vision and their insane levels of hubris currently they released a platform with such insane restrictions on the SDK it is near useless beside releasing apps that exist within the narrow imagination Apple leadership has for the device - which is basically an iPad you wear on your head"
2025-02-23T15:40:19Z,"Lack of controllers and of Beat Saber, for one.

Though I hear Sony is working with Apple on the controller front"
2025-02-23T22:58:42Z,"A problem? I thought it had many, lack of apps being the elephant in the room."

Nooope"
2025-02-23T10:38:08Z,"I‚Äôm in complete agreement here.

In this day and age, there are subscriptions on everything. I‚Äôm desperately trying to cut down on my monthly outgoings to combat the increase in living costs that we are all facing.

No way am I going to consider another monthly outgoing for an app that provides me very little in terms of enjoyment/lifestyle improvements."
2025-02-23T12:08:07Z,"Everything is a subscription nowadays, it‚Äôs insane. Most of them don‚Äôt have regional pricing either, making them super expensive for people living in cheaper countries like myself. I pay for iCloud and Spotify and those are enough subscriptions for me."
2025-02-23T12:28:03Z,"Yeah, I‚Äôm with you there.

I have kids and all I pay for some ‚Äòfamily‚Äô plans, but they‚Äôre so expensive. :(

I pay for Apple One and M365 (primarily for the storage). I work for a Microsoft partner and so get it cheaper, but even still, it‚Äôs so much money!

Amazon Prime is a must for me too because of the convenience aspect. So much money. :("

2025-02-23T10:07:21Z,Second that. I used to be a dev myself. Subscriptions are really not necessary unless you already penetrated the market. You should have a steady flow of new customers every month. Subscriptions leave little incentive to become a better product to attract new customers.
2025-02-23T10:17:32Z,"Indeed. And if it‚Äôs an app that has a monthly overhead on the dev, fair enough. But an app that reads existing data and presents it in a pretty way? lol, no."

2025-02-21T12:23:29Z,"Foldable phone sales keep growing year after year. And that's without Apple having one...

And now they are getting to the point where they are the same thickness of a iPhone when closed and have higher capacity batteries as well.

The Oppo N5 has a 5600mAh battery and is 8.93mm closed (and 4.21mm open, for a screen area _bigger_ than the iPad Mini -that has a 5078 mAh battery-) while the iPhone 16 Pro Max has a 4685mAh battery and is 8.25 mm thick.

Sure, they have compromises on cameras size the lenses don't fit. But with how good the cameras are today, it's not a huge issue.

I don't think they will replace the normal phones, but they are an attractive alternative."
2025-02-21T12:37:24Z,"I‚Äôm selling me Z Fold 6 and buying an iPad Mini. The reason? Aspect ratio. The shape of foldables means that when viewing media, you get black bars at the top and bottom that make the viewable area slightly smaller than it is on my 16 Pro Max. 

The only advantage my Fold 6 has over an iPad Mini is the 120hz screen. 

I hope Apple takes that into consideration."
2025-02-21T12:44:54Z,"Yeah, it's a compromise between one or the other. If you give it a more movie friendly aspect ratio when open, then it will be more like a square when closed.

I think it'll come down to having a phone that gets bigger (i.e. focus on non media consumption) vs having a movie friendly tablet that gets smaller (i.e. it has an weirder shape when closed).

Unless you go for triple fold (which some companies are doing), or some other format (like rollable screens) and that would work better."
2025-02-21T17:44:11Z,I actually wouldn‚Äôt mind a square folding iPhone if it had a 16:9 or 16:10 aspect ratio when unfolded

2025-02-21T15:31:45Z,"&gt;The only advantage my Fold 6 has over an iPad Mini is the 120hz screen.

I reckon the other very significant advantage is you can carry the Z Fold in your pocket.."

2025-02-21T22:01:21Z,"I did this, and while I appreciate many things about the iPad Mini, I regret the decision.  The Mini is too big to fit in a pocket and so I never carry it around.  It also has a 60hz screen."
2025-02-21T22:02:23Z,"I‚Äôd only use it when out and about with my camera/drone bag or at work, so it sort of works for me."
2025-02-21T22:21:07Z,"Yeah, I could see the Mini working really well in specific situations.  Unfortunately my situation turned out to be ""having a folding tablet in my pocket I can whip out as needed."""
2025-02-21T13:21:45Z,"I wouldn‚Äôt see this as a dealbreaker, I already consider watching long-form video (movies, TV shows) on a phone to be a subpar experience and would always go for my TV / laptop ‚Äî and YouTube videos are whatever, I don‚Äôt care what device those are on."
2025-02-21T16:25:13Z,"I miss the old iPad aspect ratio. The long/wide screen look is awful for anything other than viewing video.

2025-02-21T14:43:32Z,There‚Äôs also problem that your budget for phone and tablet are now linked into one when the buy cycle for these two devices is very different
2025-02-21T15:04:37Z,The MKBHD review yesterday was super impressive
2025-02-21T14:48:43Z,The iPhone Air will be a great test run for how much the Apple customer is willing to accept a worse camera for a novel form factor. That will probably inform their foldable strategy. If it does poorly I could see them deciding they don‚Äôt want to launch a foldable without a top quality camera.¬†
2025-02-22T00:32:03Z,"I hope not. Mainly because it doesn‚Äôt sound like, at the point of the camera, it will be a particularly thin phone (and so at the main pain point it won‚Äôt seem much better than the alternatives)."
2025-02-21T17:14:57Z,"[MKBHD just talked about this recently.](https://youtu.be/NECBCxEFMCo) The aspect ratio of being square really is a killer and I don't know how they could solve the issue, the front screen might just have to be more square to be honest, ie 8:9, so that it opens up to double the ratio, 16:9."
2025-02-22T12:52:50Z,Foldable phones will forever stay a novelty. I doubt Apple would jeopardise their iPad sales for a novelty.
2025-02-22T17:15:23Z,"The most expensive iPad costs 60% of what a foldable would cost. It would be almost 4 times the price of the iPad most likely to be replace (the Mini).

They aren't losing any money if the foldable becomes a success. Quite the opposite."
2025-02-22T17:23:36Z,"That's my point. The foldable will never become anything more than a niche product. Not until batteries become substantially better. Then you can actually use it as your everything device. But a phone that can open up to be a tablet is quite useless atm. 

The price point you're suggesting also makes zero sense. At that price point most people would rather get a regular iPhone and an iPad.

Look at how quickly Apple axed the iphone mini. And mini had devout fans just not enough sales."
2025-02-22T20:33:39Z,"&gt; The foldable will never become anything more than a niche product. 

People, including Steve Jobs, said the same thing about phablets. Now every phone have screens that are 6 or almost 7 inches.

And even if it does become a niche thing, it doesn't mean it wouldn't make sense to make anyway.

&gt; Not until batteries become substantially better.

They have bigger batteries _right now_ than non-foldable phones like the iPhone Pro Max or even than the Mini.

Granted, those could have _significantly_ bigger batteries the day Apple and Samsung adopt the same battery tech. But we've deal with this amount of battery life for a decade and most people are ok with it. 

So I don't think battery life is a problem now that they can have such large capacity batteries.

&gt; The price point you're suggesting also makes zero sense. 

That's the price point they currently have though. They are all around ~1800.

When the tech improves they might come down, but for now that seems to be it.

&gt; But a phone that can open up to be a tablet is quite useless atm.

It could also be a phone that folds in half (like the Flip style), and those are the most popular.

&gt;At that price point most people would rather get a regular iPhone and an iPad.

Well, obviously not everyone. An iPad Mini wouldn't be pocketable and as easy to carry as having a foldable phone that goes into the size of your normal iPhone. 

For some people, one portable device would win over two ""better"" specialized ones. For me, with the current tech it isn't, but it would be likely in a couple years. And for many obviously it's enough already.

&gt; And mini had devout fans just not enough sales.

Well, if it didn't sold, they it didn't have that many devout fans.

I still think there's a difference when it's a nice cheap device, where the margins are lower, compared to an expensive premium one with extra margins.

In any case, it seems Apple is interested, or these rumours wouldn't exist. We'll see how it turns out. 

IMO, it will make foldables significantly more popular. And while it will obviously not be the most sold device, I don't think it will not sell."
2025-02-21T17:37:38Z,Thanks MKBHD!
2025-02-21T18:51:49Z,"&gt;Foldable phone sales keep growing year after year.

And they make up less than 2% of all phones despite being on the market for over 5 years now. World shattering.

They are a gimmick. Like 3D TV. Try as hard as manufacturers might, they never got it off the ground despite the tech being shoved down our throats for years."
2025-02-21T20:25:27Z,"&gt; And they make up less than 2% of all phones despite being on the market for over 5 years now.

Of _all phones_ is painting it on a bad light on purpose. Especially for a new and very expensive technology.

They are significantly more expensive than the average smartphone. Almost twice as much as even the most premium ones.

According to a quick Google, the S24 Ultra sold like 16 million units. The Fold 6 has sold over 2 million and the Flip almost 3 million.

That's 1/3rd of what their top of the line product has sold is absolutely not bad.

And neither the Fold nor the Flip are the best options in the market.

There was a time were ""phablets"" were ridiculed and you can find countless articles saying Apple would _never_ make them. Not to mention Jobs talking about how 3.5 inches was perfect. Today, the smaller iPhone has a screen that is over 6 inches. Their top phone has one that is pretty much 7 inches, twice that size.

Things change."
2025-02-23T09:09:37Z,"I've started to make a point of ignoring any posts that end with the incredibly cliche ""shoved down our throats."" They usually come at the end of stupid, misinformed posts. And the one you responded to proved me right."
2025-02-21T12:14:50Z,I feel like something‚Äôs gotta change though. Is Apple just going to stick with basic iPhone releases for the next 10-20 years when the competition is still trying to innovate in different ways? People are already slowly getting bored of every yearly iPhone and something new like how the iPhone X was during its time can really get a good chunk of people back on board.

2025-02-21T13:39:52Z,That's precisely why they're migrating to services and preparing for a future where they can't primarily rely on iPhone sales. Services revenue will make up for the loss in iPhone sales.

2025-02-22T00:18:22Z,"thanks for this visual! literally have been asking for a foldable like this forever. it makes the most sense for utility. the outer screen should be one hand-able with the inner screen opening into as close to 16:9 as is feasible. a lot of foldable users currently just want a huge outer and inner screen but that kind of defeats the purpose of the device transforming. as much hate as samsung gets for the fold6, it is actually super nice to hold one handed and then folds out into a decent sized vertical reader. but it fails, as others have said, when consuming widescreen media. otherwise it's pretty awesome for productivity"

2025-02-21T15:28:19Z,This is where I‚Äôm at. If the 16 Pro Max is around $1200 how can something that might compete with iPad sales not be at least $2000. That being said I‚Äôd never pay $2k for it.

2025-02-21T12:44:06Z,"Yeah I can‚Äôt imagine something that Apple will consider its first generation of foldable to not be expensive. Look at their VR headset. 

Been waiting on this for years, hopefully they do it better than Samsung. Not dumping on Sammy, they make some good foldable phones (had a Z Fold 4 for a while). But I want the Apple polish and over engineering that they‚Äôre known for."
2025-02-21T14:29:17Z,"Yup, not upgrading until Apple releases a fold or flip iPhone. If they don‚Äôt, then the Galaxy Fold is pretty decent."

2025-02-21T15:01:20Z,"I've always wanted to try a Galaxy Fold too, same. Only problem being that Apple ecosystem is just that genuinely convenient and seamless. I really hope Apple will figure out a Fold-like iPhone.

First world issue ofc, but thinking that I'll no longer be able to easily Airdrop files between devices is already a big disincentive. Pushbullet was decent back then but in 2025 I'd imagine it would be really clunky in comparison."
2025-02-21T17:56:35Z,"There's an application called Local Send to transfer files I use from Fold 6 to MacBook Air and it works very well

2025-02-21T10:52:31Z,"Imagine this:

A flip style folding iPhone replacing the air which replaces the plus. Has the thickness of the air when unfolded. Inner screen is around 6.5-6.7 inches. 

And a book style folding iPhone replacing the pro max iPhone, or being its own thing entirely. Outer display being around the same size as current iPhones but unfolds to a screen size around or bigger than the size of the current iPad mini."

Oppo just released the N5. It's all that you mention, plus it has a larger capacity battery than both the iPhone and the iPad Mini.

So it's absolutely doable.

It's a matter of whether Apple wants to do it or not."
2025-02-21T14:55:02Z,"Manufacturing it at Oppo‚Äôs scale and manufacturing it at Apple‚Äôs scale are two very different problems. Even the Samsung version of this is a low-volume product in the grand scheme of things. I don‚Äôt think Apple cares to make a low volume product.

2025-02-21T16:18:08Z,"&gt; Manufacturing it at Oppo‚Äôs scale and manufacturing it at Apple‚Äôs scale are two very different problems. 

Sure, but also Apple has a significant advantage in resources and experience.

I'm sure if anyone can make millions of these devices, it's Apple.

And remember this is today. Apple is not expended to deliver these products for a year or two at least.

&gt; I don‚Äôt think Apple cares to make a low volume product.

Apple Vision or the Mac Pro aren't like they popular consumer products.

So maybe they will. Remember these are high cost phones. They are all around like ~$2000. While the most popular iPhone costs less than half.

So it's not like they will sell billions (at least for now)."
2025-02-21T14:15:26Z,So the Galaxy Flip and Galaxy Fold
2025-02-21T13:10:10Z,"Every time I see the rumored images of the iPhone 17 with the extended camera across the top of the phone, I can‚Äôt help but think this is laying ground for a foldable like we see with Motorola and Samsung but without the secondary screen."
2025-02-21T11:12:19Z,The problem with all those foldables is that if they fold out the screen is square. So the new wide is the same as how high your phone is (roughly). So if you now watch a video it doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs folded out or not. Watching a video on a normal phone in landscape is the same size as watching it on a folded out foldable. But the foldable is worse to hold and has huge black bars. And honestly that would at least for me be the biggest reason to even consider a foldable to watch videos on a bigger screen because social media apps are worse when bigger and you can reach everything and for real multi tasking a folded out foldable is still to small and I would always still go for my iPad Pro or MacBook/pc. So other than that it looks futuristic it‚Äôs kinda pointless tbh. At least with the now common form factor.
2025-02-21T11:56:44Z,Huawei Tri-Fold has a wide aspect ratio when fully folded out. There are options!
2025-02-21T12:01:48Z,Yes I think that those are the true future or something that can roll out the screen to get a widescreen aspect ration in the folded out state.
2025-02-21T14:38:35Z,"Yeah, but the quiet part is that it's not worth it to fold out very often. It's fun for a while, but you quickly realize that you really don't watch long videos on your phone very often."
2025-02-21T14:37:25Z,This is the biggest issue with foldable. That bigger screen size is a waste.
2025-02-21T12:39:12Z,"A huge number of people use their iPads for media consumption, and they don't have a movie friendly aspect ratio.

A 21:9 movie on an iPad 11 inches vs an iPad 12.9 looks almost exactly the same.

In any case, it's just a choice. That would be easiest thing to change/accommodate for. But instead of being a phone that gets bigger, it would be a movie friendly tablet that gets smaller."
2025-02-21T14:28:37Z,Instant buy if apple drops a foldable
2025-02-21T14:40:49Z,"‚ÄúThank you, that will be USD4K sir‚Äù - Tim"
2025-02-21T15:10:02Z,Probably would start at $2k with 128gb internal storage lol.
2025-02-21T10:49:01Z,"Man, am I gonna love it!"
2025-02-21T13:39:05Z,"I've been dailying a foldable for about the last 3 years, you'll absolutely love it it's so much better"
2025-02-21T14:50:02Z,"I'm not against foldable phones, but I think I'd rather a Gameboy SP style foldable.

I do not need an iPad in my pocket at all.

I love the screensize of my 15 PM, but hate how much space it takes up in my pockets.

That being said, the crease would have to be so minimal to get me to pick one up."
2025-02-22T00:21:17Z,Thats a Samsung Flip for you young ones
2025-02-21T15:28:33Z,I just want it to be no bigger than my 13 mini when folded.
2025-02-21T23:06:10Z,"Apple will have to disrupt the industry with the worlds first non-creased foldable screen, because shipping an Apple product with a shitty noticeable crease on the screen will be such a strong break with Apple/Jobs philosophy that they might as well just shut down the entire company."
2025-02-21T12:58:20Z,I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll release a foldable till they solve the crease issue
2025-02-21T14:49:22Z,Apple will just give us another year of simple slab but with more ‚Äúai‚Äù! Ugh.
2025-02-21T23:38:19Z,I would 100% buy an apple book style foldable
2025-02-22T19:04:06Z,"I‚Äôve had an iPhone for years, never once did I wish it would fold."
2025-02-21T14:44:47Z,"Was scrolling looking for the guy that posts the article summary so I guess I gotta do my part this time.

Today‚Äôs ‚Äúexclusive‚Äù information about Apple‚Äôs foldable comes from Weibo-based leaker Digital Chat Station, and it concerns the screen measurements. According to the Chinese leaker, the device has a 5.49-inch outer screen that resembles the new Oppo Find N5, but is shorter and wider. Meanwhile, the inner screen is 7.74 inches and unfolds like an iPad. Apparently both displays have an ‚Äúunprecedented aspect ratio.‚Äù Apple‚Äôs foldable phone will launch next year or the year after that, says the leaker, with a foldable iPad also expected to arrive within the same time frame.

Make of that what you will. The account has previously posted accurate information about the iPhone 12 mini‚Äôs display, iPhone 15‚Äôs upgraded sensor, and iPhone 16 Pro size increases."
2025-02-21T15:06:59Z,What about a foldable iPad mini?
2025-02-23T21:14:02Z,Give me a fucking Mini already instead with ProMotion and a bigger battery
2025-02-21T12:07:17Z,"my body is so ready for a foldable. 

samsung is on the Z flip 4, by now hopefully Apple has more than enough proofs to make a solid foldable device."
2025-02-21T13:36:40Z,Z Flip 4? the Z Flip 6 released last year‚Ä¶
2025-02-21T11:30:59Z,"Maybe I‚Äôm a simple man but I like the current iphone design. Pop a screen protector on, easier to handle and use it to film, etc. The idea of a foldable phone sounds cool if I wanted to edit but I‚Äôd like to see how it‚Äôll handle for photography/filming"
2025-02-21T13:16:39Z,"After seeing that latest Oppo N5, I‚Äôm actually really excited again for folding phones. They‚Äôve stopped being odd shaped thick slabs and now have become no thicker than an iPhone 16. Also the new battery tech looks promising as well. I can definitely see Apple finally feeling ‚Äòits time‚Äô"
2025-02-21T14:58:26Z,"MKBHD did a video on flip phones and how the square ratio was useless for watching videos and how although the phone had more screen than iPad mini, it was mostly black space when watching videos. This could be solved with a trifold phone"
2025-02-21T23:41:50Z,"Or with a different aspect ratio‚Ä¶ make the outer screen wider, and the inner screen will have a better aspect ratio."
2025-02-22T05:50:48Z,Maybe I‚Äôm just a Boomer but what is the fad with foldable phones? To me it just seems like another high mechanical failure point that always leaves a mark on the fold lines. Plus if you close it and any dust/sand/grit is on it and it can just bury itself in the screen or crack the glass. Do yall just really want bigger phones that badly? I can see if it becomes like iPad/ipad mini size the appeal but I really don‚Äôt get why I‚Äôd want a iPhone that just folds
2025-02-23T09:22:02Z,"As a boomer, you probably remember using flip phones in the 90s and 00s. It's a form factor that many people like, and it's as simple as that."
2025-02-21T12:11:29Z,"Pls let this not be a thing. The fold line on any foldable display is always scuffed, no screen protectors will work anymore. Just wrong."
2025-02-21T13:42:31Z,Then just don‚Äôt buy it? How does them releasing it affect you? Lmao
2025-02-21T17:27:20Z,You just taught a man to fish.
2025-02-21T22:02:02Z,About time.  Dozens of people will appreciate this!
2025-02-24T15:05:21Z,I doubt that even those who are willing to buy the VP for the retail price will enjoy Apple Intelligence
2025-02-21T20:22:20Z,I‚Äôm more worried about when Apple Intelligence is going to be useful rather than what devices it will keep expanding to.
2025-02-21T22:26:06Z,"Just a reminder : most countries in the world are still waiting for apple intelligence on their iPhones , maybe you could fix that before ‚Äúexpanding‚Äù"
2025-02-22T06:45:15Z,You‚Äôre not missing out on much.
2025-02-21T22:34:27Z,"Even those of us that already have if, are still waiting for something actually useful to do with it"
2025-02-21T23:01:49Z,I‚Äôd like normal access to Apple Vision Pro firstüò≥ Not available yet in my country.
2025-02-23T02:14:32Z,It's not available in my income level.
2025-02-22T01:47:57Z,Cool. When does it come to iPhone?
2025-02-22T10:22:51Z,Two negatives won‚Äôt make a positive.
2025-02-21T19:23:28Z,"This is great, and 2.4 is even bigger than that. It‚Äôs bringing a lot of highly requested improvements and features, including Apple Intelligence support, and major improvements to Guest Mode and a new Spatial Gallery app. Definitely click on the article from Apple, because it explains everything new.¬†

Here‚Äôs my original comment I posted on another subforum:

&gt;I highly approve of the new Spatial Gallery! This is going to be so awesome since it‚Äôs curated by Apple for Apple users. They know exactly how to get the best stuff since they made the device.¬†

&gt;And I‚Äôm so happy for bringing Apple Intelligence. I‚Äôve been saying for awhile that Craig said it was coming (though I forgot what YT video I saw him say it in), and now it‚Äôs here

&gt;I‚Äôm also excited for the new iOS app that sounds like it‚Äôll be the Apple Watch equivalent here. That‚Äôs a really great idea.

&gt;2.4 sounds great and Apple has really done a good job trying to push out requested features"
2025-02-21T18:47:37Z,"I went to the apple store the other day and not one person was stood around the vision pros, the rest of the tables were jam packed with customers"
2025-02-21T19:24:03Z,I‚Äôve seen multiple demos happening the few times I‚Äôve gone recently.¬†
2025-02-21T22:28:38Z,Everything else you can grab and try out. The Vision Pro you need a demo to test. Why would someone stand around its table besides looking at it quickly and getting the gist?
2025-02-21T18:51:24Z,Thanks for that truly groundbreaking insight.
2025-02-21T18:56:15Z,happy to help :-)
2025-02-21T23:14:42Z,Big heavy goofy  looking and badly designed goggles and overpriced without much utility or even a YouTube app or Netflix app. Not shocking!
2025-02-21T23:23:27Z,"yeah can't imagine using them, and I tend to do work at my workstation for easily 14 hours a day, it just wouldn't work from a practical standpoint and no replacable battery or usb-c, just isn't worth the headache (literal)"
2025-02-22T18:56:33Z,Not sure what you mean by no usb-c but you can plug into the battery and use AVP indefinitely if you want to not rely on battery.
2025-02-21T20:32:03Z,This will make those 4 remaining users very happy üëç

2025-02-21T18:44:45Z,"It's too bad the device didn't launch with controllers. Instead, they're adding these features that no one really uses."
2025-02-22T14:36:52Z,Great fusion of two completely useless products
2025-02-21T20:39:06Z,Not much for AI but it might be worth it on an augmented reality headset so I‚Äôll wait and see how this turns out when April comes around
2025-02-22T00:09:19Z,"It‚Äôs a problem when the photo they picked for their Image Playground *advertisement* is that creepy.

The Spatial Gallery is just bizarre; it‚Äôs another tech demo like Discover Dinosaurs. Why are they pouring energy into these instead of giving us something to actually *do* with it?

And they‚Äôre introducing a VP App for iPhone, so you can use your VP even less. Brilliant."
2025-02-22T01:50:50Z,Why?
2025-02-22T11:27:32Z,Enjoy image playground and genmoji Vision Pro users! Your productivity will sky rocket üöÄ using just these two advanced Apple intelligence tools!
2025-02-22T16:22:09Z,We need a cheaper version. I still love VR.

2025-02-23T06:06:34Z,Why
2025-02-21T19:48:16Z,They are so behind right now
2025-02-21T20:07:14Z,"Behind what, exactly? Lol. I‚Äôm so confused what you‚Äôre even referring to given what the article is about. Read the article, not the headline"
2025-02-21T20:01:25Z,Behind what? Every other company is playing catch up to VisionOS since last year?
2025-02-21T20:07:40Z,Exactly I was very confused. WTF is he talking about lol
2025-02-21T22:10:02Z, Behind in AI
2025-02-21T20:10:16Z,Apple intelligence I think.
2025-02-21T22:42:42Z,"Siri Intelligence is exactly at the level it will always be, relative to the rest."
2025-02-21T22:57:23Z,No they‚Äôve fallen behind looking at the current level of SOTA models
2025-02-23T13:49:10Z,Never noticed but it‚Äôs nice. Kind of like a little ‚Äúno‚Äù. Wouldn‚Äôt mistake it for a success sound.
2025-02-24T12:36:04Z,"It's so much better than those POS systems where the ""your card has been approved"" sound more closely resembles a ""transaction failed"" sound."
2025-02-21T11:01:34Z,TL;DR The first Geekbench score for the iPhone 16e shows a 15% performance reduction in GPU compared to the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus.
2025-02-21T11:07:12Z,Around 5 people who intended to play AAA game ports on a midrange iPhone will sure be disappointed¬†
2025-02-21T12:10:24Z,Even then it probably won‚Äôt make a massive difference in most games.
2025-02-21T16:14:08Z,How many cores do candy crush and Balatro require?
2025-02-21T12:28:02Z,Is it really midrange with that price tag?
2025-02-21T12:37:05Z,"I feel like according to the current line up it‚Äôs the low end/entry level iPhone? 

Regular iPhone 16 is the ‚Äúmid-range‚Äù of the lineup, and the Pro is the high end iPhone.

Good / Better / Best"
2025-02-21T13:48:25Z,I think midrange is in the $500-600 range these days.
2025-02-21T15:17:50Z,"I think that is correct, though it hurts to admit.

I am used to mid-range being $200-$400. And being able to get a POS for \~$50 if you were broke and had to have something that could technically make calls and text."
2025-02-21T22:58:10Z,At what point was midrange $200? 10 years ago?
2025-02-22T02:46:00Z,"Yeah and have incomes doubled even less tripled by now? Don't think so. Basically not only incomes haven't shot up like they ""should"" have but also everything is so much more expensive that technically buying power in 2025 is less than say what 5 years ago?! Shove that phone up your juicy apple ass I'd say."
2025-02-22T03:42:15Z,"That is not Apple‚Äôs fault or responsibility lmao, especially considering [Apple has increased its base pay for its lowest paid employees by $10/hour since then.](https://www.epi.org/blog/apple-store-employees-wages/)"
2025-02-21T16:00:39Z,"I‚Äôm pretty sure you can still get a POS for around $50 for bare minimum levels of communication. Though at one point in time, you could get that $50 POS that also had an android operating system and could get various apps, though running those apps were hit or miss at best. 

Nowadays, though, you‚Äôre likely to just get a very basic call/text phone at that price range."
2025-02-21T22:59:58Z,"Well that's if you're in the US. for the rest of the world with so much options of smartphone brands and models to buy, 300-500 is the range."
2025-02-21T20:20:22Z,"Relatively speaking to Apple yes, to all phones not¬†"
2025-02-21T12:37:09Z,Yes? It‚Äôs closer to the FE in Samsung‚Äôs lineup.
2025-02-21T12:45:49Z,In Europe it's basically the price of the base s25
2025-02-21T17:41:30Z,Which has a snap dragon 8 elite
2025-02-21T12:35:36Z,"That was my whole debate on another post. 

This thing, again, is relying heavily on being an iphone to justify $700 for 256gb and non-flagship specs and cuts when the smartphone space has other options."
2025-02-21T13:09:11Z,"non flagship specs? iphone 16? hello??

the only thing you can really knock is the 60Hz display but you said ‚Äúspecs‚Äù in plural"
2025-02-21T14:12:15Z,And the 2 less cameras‚Ä¶ and not having magsafe‚Ä¶ And not having ultrawideband‚Ä¶ And not having USB 3.1 (actually not even 3.0)‚Ä¶ And all of the other flagship things
2025-02-21T18:27:52Z,"Let‚Äôs be real, USB 3.0 is entry level on any other device, seeing how it is 16 years old"
2025-02-21T18:45:56Z,"By USB 3.0 I actually mean USB 3.1 (also called USB 3.1 Gen 2  and also called USB 3.2 Gen 2 because the USB specification is a naming mess). It's a little newer at 11 years old and can do 10Gbit/s, double USB 3.0.

USB 3.0 (5Gbit/s) has been standard in android flagships since 2017. But 3.1 is still not totally a standard since samsung for example still doesn't support it on their flagships. Google only launched it on the Pixel in 2023.

Still the iPhone 16 doesn't even have 3.0... It's very sad but it's been years since they started pushing for you to store everything in the cloud for a monthly fee."
2025-02-21T14:35:10Z,"""Lower high end"""
2025-02-21T14:14:45Z,"Considering it‚Äôs more expensive than just outright getting a PS5, no its not midrange"
2025-02-21T15:01:38Z,What does console pricing have to do with smartphone market segments?
2025-02-21T15:18:39Z,It is actually low end compared to their other offerings.
2025-02-22T10:28:45Z,"It's just such weak phone as the sum of its parts though. 

They had a $500 phone in the market yesterday with two cameras and optical image stabilization and optimal chips and stronger modem and magsafe and ultra wideb. 


They removed it and put in a $600 phone missing all of that stuff! Weird that people are trying to justify this but comparing inflation with the other iPhone SE3. 


My issue is that you could get a much better phone 4 days ago for a hundred bucks from Apple and now it's 600 bucks to get a shittier phone. 

They just made it so much worse for the normies that are just going to buy the cheapest iPhone they can get"
2025-02-21T13:17:30Z,"It costs as much as a Samsung Galaxy S25, mid rangers cost 300-500‚Ç¨, max. 

The 16e is 699‚Ç¨ here, a normal 16 is 780‚Ç¨.  
It's by far not a midrange phone anymore."
2025-02-21T14:08:18Z,"Well also for longevity wise it's not good either.

Apple is already behind Qualcomm in GPU."
2025-02-21T11:37:15Z,They‚Äôre on their knees. Who will save them?
2025-02-21T12:38:18Z,I just dropped to my knees in a Circuit City.
2025-02-21T15:04:32Z,"""Sweetie, are you sure this new phone is working right? The candies aren't crushing like they did on my old one."""
2025-02-21T11:08:51Z,Not bad considering the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus has 25% more GPU cores than the 16e
2025-02-21T11:45:05Z,25% more than 80 is 100. But 80 is 20% less than 100. So basically a 20% reduction in cores leads to 15% reduction in performance?
2025-02-21T11:47:38Z,Maybe the clock is a bit higher to compensate
2025-02-21T15:43:59Z,Tale as old as time. Bigger clocks to compensate.
2025-02-21T20:02:52Z,Word around the office if you‚Äôve got a big clock. I have a big clock too.
2025-02-22T03:18:29Z,Know what they say about big hands?
2025-02-21T16:40:32Z,"Beyond sample variance, that remaining 5% gap could just be extra thermal headroom leading to more stable clocks."
2025-02-21T12:39:19Z,"Ok but is Siri Intelligence affected? I don‚Äôt want it to be complete rubbish.  Oh good, no change."
2025-02-21T14:29:43Z,Someone uses Siri?
2025-02-21T15:19:32Z,"It is complete rubbish, but that‚Äôs the universal experience right now, not hardware specific."
2025-02-21T23:25:03Z,The only thing that‚Äôs stopping me from trading in the pro max is the fear of tiny Balatro
2025-02-21T12:41:18Z,"15% it's less than iPhone 16 throttling after heating up, right?"
2025-02-21T13:17:53Z,"‚ÄúApple Uses Binned Chips In Lower-Cost Devices‚Äù isn‚Äôt news, it‚Äôs how they avoid creating tons of e-waste while being able to offer a more affordable option for kids, seniors, and people who want an iPhone but don‚Äôt want to spend $1000/can‚Äôt afford a Pro model."
2025-02-21T13:50:14Z,It should've had a different name. The A18 Pro has 1 more GPU core than the A18 and accordingly gets the Pro moniker. Nvidia gets a ton of shit for naming GPUs the same but having wildly different performance numbers.
2025-02-21T14:32:02Z,"But A18 and A18 pro, gpu is not the only difference."
2025-02-21T14:20:14Z,Sure but this isn't the first time. Apple already does this in their desktop chips. There are multiple versions of M4 pro and max depending on the gpu count. These are just binned versions.
2025-02-21T14:22:26Z,"The differences between the m4, m4 pro, and m4 max are far bigger. M4 max has triple the performance cores of M4 pro and double the amount of gpu cores. 

Same story with m4 pro. Not a 15% increase in cores, but more like 50~100%"
2025-02-21T14:41:43Z,"No. He‚Äôs talking within the same tier. 

There are M4 Pro chips with different core counts. (Just M4 Pro, not Max)"
2025-02-21T14:52:40Z,"M4 max binned has 14 cpu and 30 gpu. Unbinned has 16 and 40. That‚Äôs a 33% difference, compared to 15% difference between a18 and a18 pro. 

A18 pro is supposed to be a higher lineup, and yet the core difference is the same as buying an m4 imac with the binned m4 or unbinned m4. 

I‚Äôm saying ‚Äúpro‚Äù naming scheme doesn‚Äôt make sense here. The difference is too minimal."
2025-02-21T15:05:56Z,"The A18 Pro has many other differences too. It‚Äôs not just the core. It has better IO, better video decode, better display engine, etc‚Ä¶

When apple uses different names, it‚Äôs because they‚Äôre actually different production lines not because they‚Äôre binned. 

E.g the M series Max and Pro may seem similar but have always had to be distinct production lines if you look at any of the SoC image scans. And within each line, they‚Äôve had binned versions of each."
2025-02-21T15:01:01Z,"Realistically unlikely to make a difference. iOS developers tend to program for the weakest of the mainline phones which would be 16e now, the extra processing power is just extra speed. Unless we are talking about those unique console games that have appearing in the App Store."
2025-02-21T22:03:51Z,"When the performance difference won‚Äôt matter to 99% of users, it doesn‚Äôt need a different name. For everyday use, the difference will be inconceivable."
2025-02-21T15:42:32Z,So still significantly faster than the iPhone 15
2025-02-22T10:29:54Z,I really don't think the speed matters all that much. Big issue is that doesn't have optical image stabilization and that's something normies will notice.
2025-02-22T11:55:17Z,"It does have optical image stabilization, read the specs."
2025-02-21T13:43:47Z,"The SE market tend to keep their devices for 3/4+ years. Given that a refurbished 15 Pro goes for ~¬£630, I can see the 16e falling short of the SE. Last gen phones have roughly the same support window with some extra features.

The mini iPhones failed pretty bad, but I do think there was an attraction to the SE phones keeping the old, more compact form-factor."
2025-02-21T17:47:40Z,"No one who buys this phone is even going to know about this, or care. Heck, I couldn't care less if my 15 PM came with one GPU core less."
2025-02-22T02:34:35Z,"Skimping on GPU Performance - Not too bad for most phone applications. Games might run worse, but alright. We're used to hardware tiers like that in the gaming space already.

Skimping on RAM - Really bad. See iPhone 6 and 6+ for what happened with that. Thankfully Apple doesn't appear to have skimped on RAM with this model."
2025-02-21T14:41:52Z,And 0 people will be affected by the difference
2025-02-21T21:44:41Z,"Folks, I don‚Äôt get this subreddit. Why on earth is anyone here trying to find or create any form of hype for this phone?

It‚Äôs a barebones phone. There‚Äôs nothing to examine deeply here beyond that new in-house cellular modem. It‚Äôs priced higher, but there‚Äôs likely external reasons for that.

Not every new product Apple releases will be amazing/revolutionary/must-have.

It‚Äôs not a mini phone. It‚Äôs not a new category of phone. It‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ a normal smartphone. That‚Äôs it.

Is that why this is so remarkable? That it‚Äôs so basic and missing features?"
2025-02-21T12:11:28Z,"I‚Äôm sure the zombie scroll generation will be ‚ÄúOK‚Äù

2025-02-21T16:26:13Z,They likely weren‚Äôt ever aware of core counts in the first place.

Any ideas?"
2025-02-22T10:25:02Z,Does it matter? No. But please ffs can Apppe just give these cut down chips a name. Like A18e?¬†

2025-02-21T12:41:19Z,Cook has his Billions now. That‚Äôs the main thing. Him and the investors.
2025-02-21T13:49:40Z,"I don‚Äôt think that really matters, considering he‚Äôs planning on donating all of his money to charity. 

It‚Äôs not future generational wealth. Any bonuses he get just means more money to charities at this point."
2025-02-21T13:55:43Z,‚ÄúAll of his money‚Äù? That‚Äôs huge if true.
2025-02-21T14:03:55Z,"Theres something about college for his nephews. And of course the running of whatever foundation is formed to do it.  Beyond that I hadn‚Äôt heard of many caveats. But it‚Äôs up to the future to see how things go.

2025-02-21T13:50:02Z,"The Pro Models are double this price, how else are we surprised?

Quite frankly surprised the regular iPhone 16 is maintaining at $800."
2025-02-21T14:57:07Z,The prices you see are just sticker prices. Apple is known to fiddle around prices on the distribution backend to offload sticks.
2025-02-21T15:13:46Z,"Never have I seen an iPhone priced below sticker(ignoring the really old SE models they'll offload). The rest of Apples lineup, yes."
2025-02-21T15:20:08Z,"Well, technically, all phone + carrier plans are possible because Apple sells them at a carrier exclusive prices.

2025-02-22T06:29:31Z,There‚Äôs a reason they‚Äôre comparing it to an iPhone 11
2025-02-21T13:15:45Z,What does this mean for battery life?
2025-02-21T13:56:40Z,"Nothing significant. It's still the same processor architecture, so there's no significant gain with less cores."
2025-02-21T13:24:51Z,"Nothing really except when it comes to playing a very demanding game, which you will be using more battery to get the same results as a non-binned chip  in day did they use? There‚Äôs probably absolutely no difference as a result of the reduce video core counts, since the majority of real people use the phone for which is video and social media post they don‚Äôt need any real GPU power"
2025-02-21T15:13:21Z,IPhone 16e is such a Tim Cook‚Äôs product.

2025-02-21T13:38:58Z,I'll count that as one less year until the phone's sooo slow it's frustrating to use
2025-02-21T13:53:56Z,"I‚Äôll count that as being about as fast as the 15 pro, yet being purchased for people who won‚Äôt be expecting high end usage like pro buyers would."
2025-02-21T15:34:14Z,Could it mean that the e won‚Äôt be getting some of the update features that the other 16s get. I see it being treated like an older model when it comes to updates.

2025-02-21T17:56:22Z,"why the downvotes?  
seriously, folks

I'm rocking an iPhone SE first generation, and I've waited for the next iPhone SE, or the next iPhone mini

Today I asked the shop if they have the 16e so I can try it out, and then they told me to come back later

I wish I could use my 1st SE for a few more years  
but I can't because it's too slowww

Why do I get the hate?

2025-02-22T18:06:22Z,"Re: AirPods Max repair

Looking for advice: my AirPods stopped connecting to Bluetooth, I took them in to the Apple Store to get repaired, was told $99 for a new battery and agreed to that. Then I got an email saying they found another issue : ‚ÄúThere is a hardware issue affecting the normal function of the ethernet port.‚Äù Is all the email said.

I never use the Ethernet port so I don‚Äôt necessarily care if it‚Äôs broken, but the email gives me the option to pay $399 or get the item back.

I‚Äôm pretty disappointed as I bought these in March 2022 I thought they would last much longer than this. Do you have any suggestions on how to proceed? Does Apple ever make exceptions or adjustments to the repair price for you? Would a 3rd party repair be less than $399? Thanks in advance!"
2025-02-22T18:55:30Z,Nope. You‚Äôll have to get a new pair. They lasted about 3 years which is pretty good. And navy buy new AirPods during the second to third year since the health of the battery depletes in that time.

2025-02-22T18:56:51Z,If you want to take lots of pictures then go for the 16. If you dont then get the 16e for better battery life.

2025-02-22T13:10:26Z,"I wouldn't recommend an SE, the screen is too small. And since the 16e was just released I wouldn't expect an immediate price drop either. You can take a look at any of the 15 models. They're just as good as the 16 for your use case and the price is probably lower because they are last year's models."

2025-02-20T15:48:54Z,"Ever since Apple TV+ launched they‚Äôve put out some absolutely banger shows, legitimately some of the best tv in recent years‚Ä¶ and then done absolutely nothing to promote or advertise them, crazy that they‚Äôre failing so hard in the marketing depts for these shows, and great to see Ted Lasso and Severance get their flowers regardless. Now, go watch Shrinking!"
2025-02-20T16:14:10Z,"Apple and A24 seem to have a similar marketing strategy, where they spend next to nothing on telling people about the shows, focus on quality, and let word of mouth, awards, and accolades do the marketing for them."
2025-02-20T19:14:32Z,I‚Äôm not a cinephile by any stretch of the imagination but i can spot an a24 production from a mile away. I hope some mba suits don‚Äôt come in and lead them to don‚Äôt lose their luster.
2025-02-20T23:10:45Z,It's bound to happen eventually. But another studio will come along. It's all a cycle.
2025-02-20T23:04:19Z,"That's kinda already happened but whether it will affect the product or not remains to be seen. 

One of the Kushner brothers with his venture capital and some other venture capital invested a ton in A24 and are now on the board."
2025-02-20T19:49:23Z,"I think A24's design, nice type treatments, books they produce, and style of trailers or anything they make, visual feel, style of films, IS their marketing."
2025-02-20T16:28:49Z,Love me some A24.
2025-02-20T16:15:29Z,I think one of the bottlenecks to low subscribers is people incorrectly thinking they need an Apple device to use Apple TV+. And the Apple TV+ app for Android only recently released.

2025-02-21T02:48:04Z,Best pacing of any show. I'm always shocked when the hour is up. Great tv.
2025-02-20T22:49:26Z,For All Mankind is probably one of the BEST shows I've ever seen. There were a few episodes where I was literally off the couch standing in front of the TV in anticipation of what was happening next.
2025-02-21T11:28:15Z,I think the later seasons are a lot weaker and some of the characters just don‚Äôt evolve very well. Still good but not as great as the beginning.
2025-02-20T22:33:50Z,"For All Mankind (Gordo!‚Äôs arc), The Morning Show (Billy Crudup!), and Shrinking were my favorites‚Ä¶definitely binge worthy."

2025-02-20T16:35:21Z,"Acapulco is a hugely underrated show. It‚Äôs fun, different, laid back, funny and just makes me smile every time I watch it."
2025-02-20T16:54:08Z,"I just finished Shrinking and started Severance. Ted Lasso is what I started Apple TV+ with so I guess I am going in reverse order after Ted Lasso.

Honestly I can‚Äôt think of any Apple ‚Äúoriginal‚Äù I‚Äôve watched that I didn‚Äôt think was well done. They‚Äôre not all for me or my ‚Äúfavorite‚Äù, but overall they‚Äôve really delivered overwhelmingly strong content IMO."
2025-02-20T18:30:04Z,"I haven't watched the most recent season of MQ, but I do have to say that I was surprised by how thoughtful the show can be at times.  Obviously there are the stand-out episodes that have received a lot of praise, but even in the main storyline, they will tackle things like imposter syndrome, regret, and complex friendship dynamics that I wouldn't necessarily expect to see in a show that is equally comfortable making a silly fart joke.  Overall a pretty good show, but one that I don't recommend to just anyone."
2025-02-20T18:57:32Z,The best episodes imo are the retrospective ones not about the main cast. Like the best episode in season one for me was about the first company that operated in their building.
2025-02-20T22:35:34Z,They're doing that as a series now: [Side Quest.](https://tv.apple.com/us/show/side-quest/umc.cmc.1pwtcaq7wyb6hdz2ctk1tvtng)
2025-02-20T15:57:50Z,Also The Studio starring Seth Rogen looks great.
2025-02-20T21:20:28Z,"Shrinking was one of those shows I was iffy about, mainly because I have honestly not seen Jason Segal as anything other than Marshal from HIMYM. He had a few genuinely serious moments in that show but overall his character was goofier. When I saw him in Shrinking though, I will never doubt again. This show made me cry several times, and that's not even saying how fucking amazing Harrison Ford is in it. His portrayal of someone with ever worsening Parkinson's should be praised alone."
2025-02-20T16:02:36Z,"It‚Äôs a toss up between Severance, For All Mankind, and Slow Horses for which is my favorite, they‚Äôre all instant classics.
Foundation and Morning Shoe are good as well, but not top tier.
Physical was also amazing.

Basically aside from Acapulco (wrong age demographic) and Silo, every show I‚Äôve watched so far has been well worth watching."

2025-02-20T16:28:12Z,My wife calls For All Mankind my space soap opera.
2025-02-20T17:17:56Z,"It didn't start off as a soap opera it started off focusing more on the SciFi, then gradually became more of a soap opera as it focused on problems between characters. I loved how it started, don't like it as much now."
2025-02-20T16:50:52Z,Morning show season 1 is top tier. ¬†Didn‚Äôt bother to watch after that.
2025-02-20T17:05:45Z,"It keeps getting better in my opinion.

I am not sure if it's top tier but it's awfully close."
2025-02-20T16:00:43Z,"Their sci-fi series are also pretty good. Foundation and Silo are quite well done. Silo is a bit annoying for changing the story and swapping genders of characters for no apparent reason but else than that its pretty good. But i havent seen any marketing for them.. I accidentally found Foundation when it came and was almost certain thats surely this cant be THE Foundation by Asimov.
I think ive seen few ada of the series with Jason Mamoa, the name of which I sont even remember.. nore have I seen."
2025-02-20T17:18:24Z,"For All Mankind is probably one of my favorite things. There are *some* cliches and forced writing, but just exploring the alternate reality space race is great. There also *are* significant plot things happening like main characters dying, etc."
2025-02-20T17:33:30Z,"I just finished Silo S2 and haven‚Äôt read the book(s?), which characters are gender swapped?"
2025-02-20T20:38:57Z,Pretty sure its just Walker (the old mentor character with agoraphobia).
2025-02-20T17:00:55Z,"I heard they made Foundation but also heard it wasn‚Äôt great. Haven‚Äôt watched yet.¬†

I did just watch Silo. Had a great first two episodes but then really fell flat for a long time. The last two eps were good, though, good enough for me to check out S2.¬†

I believe you‚Äôre thinking of See. I‚Äôve also heard bad things about that one, but might try it.¬†"
2025-02-20T17:57:14Z,"My wife isn‚Äôt a big sci-fi fan, but Foundation is maybe now her favourite TV show of all time?

My understanding is that if you read the source material, you won‚Äôt enjoy the adaptation - we haven‚Äôt, and we absolutely love it!"
2025-02-20T19:15:31Z,"I've started Foundation a few times but never got through it.  Good to know that's a benefit, ha."
2025-02-20T20:38:22Z,"Foundation is really good and is probably the most beautiful show on TV. Plus you get to watch Lee Pace fight people completely naked. 

The most difficult part is the shows narrative bounces around time A LOT and it is pretty difficult to get a grasp on. Like Gaal goes into cyrosleep a few times, Jared Harris is alternating between being a projection/actually alive, and we go through a few different Brother Days. Because the actors are the same, it gets confusing until you get a good grasp on it."
2025-02-20T15:48:20Z,"I‚Äôm surprised because Ted Lasso seems like it has much more general appeal. Severance is kind of a weird ass show with a very bleak premise.

I‚Äôm ALSO not surprised because it‚Äôs an incredible show with incredible writing, acting, directing, design, everything. It‚Äôs one of my favorite shows and I‚Äôm very happy it‚Äôs getting recognition."
2025-02-20T18:38:45Z,"&gt; Ted Lasso seems like it has much more general appeal. Severance is kind of a weird ass show with a very bleak premise.

2025-02-20T17:27:40Z,"I fell off of Ted Lasso after Season 2.  I tried Season 3 but couldn‚Äôt get into it.  I felt like they really took a turn but not in a great way. 

I miss Season 1 Ted Lasso."
2025-02-20T18:55:49Z,"I think it's because Season 1 was more about the football itself and alluded more to how the team did and how it was Ted vs the world. 

The thing that made it amazing were the characters and how they drove the plot. Then in season 2 onward, they focused on the drama between the characters almost exclusively and made the football just be a setting instead of a driving force.

Season 1 really was one of my favorite pieces of media. I just wish they kept that formula."
2025-02-20T18:11:58Z,IMO it fell off after season 1. Season 2 was such a mess and it was all over the place. And then Nate becoming a villain by the end was the worst character development I‚Äôve seen on that show. It‚Äôs sad cuz season 1 was some of the best TV I‚Äôve seen and I heard it only got worse after season 2
2025-02-20T22:58:55Z,"Season 3 was just horrible. Full stop. So many problems. 

Why can only Higgins be happy in a relationship? 
We got no excerpts or readings of Trent‚Äôs book that he works on over the ENTIRE season. 
The ex wife‚Äôs BF being a bad guy was real trite.
Rupert wearing Darth Vader clothing, what was that.

2025-02-20T17:11:00Z,I'm so jealous of you - I'd love to be able to watch that again for the first time.
2025-02-20T16:11:15Z,Severance is such a cool show because of the innie/outie concept. Really keeps you interested the whole time. I‚Äôm not aware of another show that has this type of premise and it makes it super fresh
2025-02-20T17:36:57Z,"Lost was kinda the same way. You had the stuff going on in current time on the island, then flash backs/forwards/sideways to gain new insight into why the characters are the way they are, or how the island changed them. It was like each character was split in two; pre and post island."
2025-02-21T05:02:55Z,Lost is way more analogous with Silo than Severance
2025-02-20T15:54:43Z,"Severance is Apple TV‚Äôs best work yet by far. Hopefully they don‚Äôt blow it once the curtain is pulled. All the other Apple TV dramas wish they were as good as Severance, but most of them are total slogs. 

Ted Lasso is sweet and funny but ultimately I think it is a show of its time and will not age well. But I am surprised that the numbers are saying Severance is more popular this soon."
2025-02-20T16:10:48Z,"&gt; Ted Lasso is sweet and funny but ultimately I think it is a show of its time and will not age well.

I've rewatched Ted Lasso over the last two months and, in my opinion, the first season is absolutely bulletproof, like the tightest show I've ever seen (second only to maybe True Detective Season 1). Actually, a lot like Severance season 1 in that the writing is crisp and straight forward and the payoff every episode, and then all season long, is well-earned. 


Season 2 is fantastic and Season 3 is great (but not as good, and would have been better if they'd made it two seasons and kept the shorter, crisp, less meandering writing of the first two seasons). I think Ted Lasso will age fabulously, particularly because of season 1."
2025-02-20T16:51:25Z,"I've seen a lot of people bagging on season 3 of Ted Lasso, but I thought it was great. It wasn't as good as season 1 or 2, but those are big shoes to fill."
2025-02-20T16:02:43Z,I actually think Slow Horses is Apple TV‚Äôs best work.
2025-02-20T16:24:55Z,"Severance is probably their best show, but my favorite would either be Silo or Ted Lasso. But honestly I've enjoyed every Apple TV show I have watched so far."
2025-02-20T17:11:45Z,I‚Äôve been meaning to watch Silo. Currently watching Halt and Catch Fire then I‚Äôll probably get into Silo.

Severance is an absolute banger.

Ted Lasso slapped.¬†

Silo S1 was great but S2 dropped in quality but seemed to have gotten better towards the end. S3 will back to form I‚Äôd reckon.¬†

2025-02-20T17:10:11Z,"Eh, Ted Lasso is a feel-good show that came out at a time everyone felt like shit. I think it's rated just fine, even if the later seasons don't come close to the first."
2025-02-20T17:03:55Z,"First season was pretty good, everything else was meh.¬†"
2025-02-20T16:23:30Z,"Season 1 of Ted Lasso was great, S2 was OK, S3 was awful.

They tried way way too hard to push social commentary in the later end of the show and it came off as way too on the nose."

2025-02-21T01:29:42Z,"what would be nice is to have it all in one device rather than seperately. Even if it does the same stuff it would mean:

2025-02-20T21:12:53Z,"&gt;Apple will use its own custom-designed Wi-Fi chip in all upcoming iPhone 17 models, according to industry analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.

&gt;Writing in a post on X (Twitter), Kuo said the switch to in-house Wi-Fi chips will ""enhance connectivity across Apple devices"" while also giving Apple a cost reduction.

&gt;All current iPhone models are equipped with a combined Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chip supplied by Broadcom, but Kuo has previously said he expects Apple to equip ""nearly all"" of its products with its own in-house Wi-Fi chip ""within about three years.""

&gt;Kuo in October predicted that at least one iPhone 17 model launching next year will be equipped with an Apple-designed Wi-Fi chip. In the previous report, Kuo said Apple's chip would support ""the latest Wi-Fi 7 spec,"" but he did not provide any further details, and his latest post does not mention a Wi-Fi version number.

&gt;All four iPhone 16 models already support Wi-Fi 7 with Broadcom's chip, but they have some limited specifications.

&gt;Jeff Pu, another analyst who covers companies within Apple's supply chain, said in November 2024 that only the iPhone 17 Pro models will be equipped with an Apple-designed Wi-Fi 7 chip, but Apple's plans may have changed since then.

&gt;With Wi-Fi 7 support, iPhone 17 models could leverage the 2.4GHz, 5GHz, and 6GHz bands simultaneously when paired with a compatible router, enhancing data transfer speeds, reducing latency, and improving overall connection stability. Qualcomm states that Wi-Fi 7 can achieve peak speeds exceeding 40 Gbps, making it up to four times faster than Wi-Fi 6E.

&gt;Apple's Wi-Fi chip is distinct from the C1 modem chip that Apple debuted in the iPhone 16e on Wednesday. However, it is believed that Apple wants to combine these into a single component. Ultimately, the goal is to create a wireless setup where the components are tightly integrated and more energy efficient, allowing Apple to cut down on the battery use of cellular, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth technologies."
2025-02-20T22:31:11Z,"Wonder if they'll just integrate it with the C-chip in the future. Have 1 chip (modem, WiFi, Bluetooth) do all the connectivity.

2025-02-20T23:06:19Z,"Can someone explain to me what‚Äôs wrong with current iPhone connectivity chips, and why they need to make their own?

Is it like with the processor - Decided they can do a better job and make everything work together better / faster? Is there a specific problem like speed that they are trying to solve?"
2025-02-20T23:14:06Z,"Innovation and efficiency (and efficiency includes potential cost savings). And essentially what you said.

It‚Äôs better to improve something you designed yourself and to even decide how soon to launch it rather than work with what someone else made."
2025-02-21T00:09:31Z,"Qualcomm licence are hella expensive (and get even more each year).
Also vertical integration allow for more granular control like some sort of ¬´¬†deep sleep¬†¬ª shit when cellular is not needed and more"
2025-02-20T23:23:30Z,It‚Äôs to make themselves more money. They implement all these cost savings measures but pay attention to how it never trickles down to you.
2025-02-21T08:50:18Z,"Ah yes, guess Apple leaving intel and making their own chips didn‚Äôt benefit us at all I guess."
2025-02-20T21:55:52Z,"Is this different the C1? 

Is that one cellular and this is wifi or is this stuff one and the same?

Cellular MacBooks when?"
2025-02-20T22:08:45Z,"WiFi != cellular. Also, Apple could have made a cellular MacBook at any point. They just don't seem interested in that kind of product."
2025-02-20T22:20:53Z,Yeah they could have very easily slapped a Qualcomm modem and an antenna in the M series MacBooks but they aren‚Äôt going to.
2025-02-20T22:25:39Z,"Kinda surprising why they don‚Äôt tbh, they do a 200$ cellular up charge on the iPads and I‚Äôm sure they are making a solid profit on that why not give the option for Mac‚Äôs? Just extra possible money for them"
2025-02-21T04:42:45Z,Because buying an iPhone in addition to a Mac is even more extra money for them
2025-02-21T04:43:52Z,I feel like there‚Äôs a slim minority of people who buy Mac‚Äôs without an iPhone? Also why couldn‚Äôt you just hotspot from any phone? You can it‚Äôs just an extra annoyance vs having cellular on the Mac itself

I don't think Apple have been able to make a modem as fast and efficient than the one from Qualcomm , they have years and years of experience with RF and i don't think that only with the experience they get from Intel modem section they have been able to provide something better. However for WI-FI and BT Intel was good with their chips if i remember correctly in the past.



Iphone 17 Pro model rumors sound like less and less exciting this year if real : titanium to aluminum frame , ugly camera back design , Apple C1 Chip sound like a beta test that should not be on Pro version to begin with."

2025-02-20T19:29:52Z,You have pointed the camera at a restaurant sign and got information about that restaurant in return?
2025-02-20T21:43:51Z,I think you‚Äôre replying to a bot lol. That sentence makes no sense for how one would use visual intelligence.
2025-02-21T01:46:44Z,Couldn‚Äôt you walk around and use it? Or it doesn‚Äôt work like that? I thought apple said that was a thing?
2025-02-21T18:00:59Z,"You missed the second part of his sentence.

&gt;to look up restaurants in my area that I might want to visit

Why would you ""visit"" a restaurant you're literally taking a picture of? Sure, snap a picture to look at a menu, but you're already there, how do you visit something when you're already there"
2025-02-22T09:47:02Z,"If you live in a city, chances are that you pass by a lot of places that you‚Äôre not going to visit in that moment. With restaurants it does make sense to look them up in the moment, and then save that for later reference."
2025-02-21T04:27:17Z,"Walk up to a restaurant and snap a photo of their full sign, press ask, and ask away."
2025-02-21T04:26:20Z,I‚Äôm not a bot. You guys just simply have no idea how to make use of powerful technologies that are given to you. ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
2025-02-21T04:25:38Z,"Yes. I literally point the visual intelligence camera to a sign and then press ask, which then asks ChatGPT anything you can type about what you want to know about that restaurant. What they serve, their reviews, what their prices are‚Äî whatever. It‚Äôs very useful, and if you have visual intelligence, you should try it."
2025-02-21T04:42:39Z,"Yea, the ChatGPT portion works fine, but that‚Äôs nothing you couldn‚Äôt already do with the CharGPT app. 

Visual Intelligence was advertised to have the ability to recognize restaurant signs and display the information on your screen without sending anything to Google or ChatGPT. That feature does not work."
2025-02-21T04:46:24Z,I am aware that the feature isn‚Äôt implemented yet. I was discussing the ask ChatGPT button in visual intelligence to be more transparent.
2025-02-20T14:09:32Z,"From the article: Apple's new iPhone 16e, announced on Wednesday, supports Visual Intelligence despite having no Camera Control button, and now Apple has confirmed that the Apple Intelligence feature is coming to the iPhone 15 Pro as well in a future software update.

On iPhone 16 models, Visual Intelligence lets you use the camera to learn more about places and objects around you. It can also summarize text, read text out loud, translate text, search Google for items, ask ChatGPT, and more.

The feature is activated via the Camera Control button that's exclusive to iPhone 16 models. It was thought that the extra button was necessary to activate the feature, but the new iPhone 16e lacks such a button. Instead, Visual Intelligence can be assigned to the device's Action button or enabled via Control Center.

Now, Apple has told [Daring Fireball's](https://daringfireball.net/2025/02/thoughts_and_observations_on_todays_iphone_16e_announcement) John Gruber that Visual Intelligence is coming to the iPhone 15 Pro ""in a future software update."" Like the iPhone 16e, the iPhone 15 Pro doesn't have a Camera Control button, but Apple says the function will be able to be launched in the Control Center interface or via the Action button once the update drops.

Apple would not confirm whether the update in question is iOS 18.4, beta releases for which are expected any day now. But given that the iPhone 16e will become available to buy on February 28, iOS 18.4 seems like the most likely update that will bring Visual Intelligence to the iPhone 15 Pro. Following yesterday's debut of the iPhone 16e, Apple updated its website to indicate that iOS 18.4 will be released publicly in April."
2025-02-20T15:20:33Z,"So buying the 15 Pro was such a good investment, I‚Äôm not even sure if I‚Äôll upgrade to the 17 or wait another year."
2025-02-20T16:44:39Z,"I'm planning to sit on the 15 Pro for a while unless there's a major camera or battery improvement soon. Ideally it'll hold out until the phones get another RAM bump and the dynamic island is gone, which will probably take a while."
2025-02-20T19:47:08Z,"Still rocking my 13 and have seen no compelling reason to upgrade. The Air model this year might do it for me, but I‚Äôll have to wait and see"
2025-02-21T07:49:17Z,RAM has almost always been the cutoff for features for older devices
2025-02-20T15:55:39Z,"I‚Äôm probably going to upgrade to the 17 Pro because by then my battery health will be quite close to 80% and I am hoping that the camera improvements between two generations will be significant. With that said, the 15 Pro has been the best iPhone I‚Äôve ever used and I will miss it."
2025-02-20T16:36:53Z,15Pro is best since the 4s for me but just get a battery swap and wait
2025-02-20T18:19:03Z,No battery swaps where I live. I might look into a battery replacement if I have the funds to go on a holiday to a country that has an Apple Store. I really don‚Äôt want to part with my 15 Pro either haha.
2025-02-20T22:17:28Z,"Just get a replacement and tools from ifixit, they are quite easy to chance with some spare time."
2025-02-22T07:33:48Z,"I‚Äôve been considering it. Similar to the guy above, my battery life has taken a pretty big hit and I‚Äôm definitely not gonna upgrade to the 16 pro. I have yet to see anything from the leaks to convince for 17 either"
2025-02-20T18:20:22Z,"I have Applecare and I‚Äôve been trying to purposely reach 80% before it expires on November, or just let it break and get a replacement lol"
2025-02-20T20:19:13Z,I‚Äôve been trying to get mine down to 80% too but it‚Äôs just not happening. I may do what I did with my 8 Plus and smash it and then take it to the Apple Store and get a replacement for $99ü§£
2025-02-20T15:44:47Z,"This was the first year since I joined the iUP that I didn‚Äôt upgrade my phone and I don‚Äôt know that I‚Äôll need the 17 this year either. I‚Äôm glad they‚Äôre adding this feature to the 15 Pros. I frequently take picture of things and ask ChatGPT about it. Now I won‚Äôt need to take the picture, go to the screenshot and ask Siri what is this and confirm I want to use ChatGPT to answer that."
2025-02-20T18:21:08Z,"I needed a new phone like 2 months before the 16 came out, so I upgraded to the 15 Pro Max. Seems like I didn‚Äôt really miss out on anything major."
2025-02-20T17:57:05Z,Came here to upvote and say the exact same thing! I went from the 13 Mini which I really loved for the size to the 15 Pro for the AOD notifications but I am no longer upgrading my phone anymore at this point. I wish Apple would just make a smaller sized phone with the latest screen tech that would be amazing. Instead every option we get now seems to be either 6.3 inches or 6.9 inches...
2025-02-20T20:16:22Z,I absolutely love my 15 Pro. No intentions on getting rid of it but I may replace the battery soon as I can certainly tell it‚Äôs not lasting as long as it used to.
2025-02-20T18:59:50Z,"Im excited for the air, my wife is excited to get my 15pm, this camera is over kill for me any way."
2025-02-20T22:14:01Z,I would agree; only reason I upgraded was because mine got stolen and I tried to find the silver lining somewhere üòû.
2025-02-21T06:00:37Z,"If this is true, I might do the same. I might just stick with the 15 Pro Max I have and probably just get a battery swap. Visual intelligence was the main reason why I was planning on upgrading my phone this year."
2025-02-21T15:21:33Z,"If you‚Äôre upgrading every other year, you‚Äôre doing it wrong. These phones should last 5 years *at least*."
2025-02-20T16:31:34Z,Nice! Was low key pissed to see the 16e get that feature for the action button. Glad Apple is being sensible here.
2025-02-20T14:16:45Z,Thank god! Makes sense considering how heavily Apple is pushing intelligence
2025-02-21T04:45:31Z,All I want is the Photographic Styles from the 16 to trickle down to the 15 Pro. There‚Äôs no technical reason they can‚Äôt do it.
2025-02-21T05:15:56Z,But there‚Äôs another reason why they won‚Äôt.
2025-02-21T15:01:52Z,$$$
2025-02-20T16:58:42Z,"Where are all the morons who were claiming conspiracy and angry and blah blah yesterday about this?

That comment section on MacRumors epitomizes stupidity. They claim no one was upgrading for Apple Intelligence, yet they are simultaneously saying that Apple ‚Äòscammed‚Äô customers by not including this on the Action button on day one, ensuring people upgraded to the latest gen.

Which is it, morons?"
2025-02-20T18:42:32Z,I can't stand MacRumors fanboys.
2025-02-20T17:44:56Z,I‚Äôm convinced that people just get paid by Samsung or whoever to post stupid opinions about Apple online. That‚Äôs the only explanation.
2025-02-20T18:15:27Z,Fully agreed
2025-02-20T18:26:15Z,Because it would not be not typical for apple
2025-02-20T18:28:25Z,"How?

M3 got dual monitor support when you closed lid on the MBA. Apple released a software update to bring that same feature to the M3 MBP released before that.¬†

They have a history of not scamming people. Lmfao."
2025-02-20T20:43:49Z,I just want HomePod Siri to get a ai upgrade so it says the answer and not just here is what I found on the web
2025-02-20T22:59:37Z,Good move from apple. Doesn‚Äôt go well when 16e supports the feature and 15pro doesn‚Äôt
2025-02-20T19:18:17Z,I found asking Siri to search whats on my screen using ChatGPT is much more helpful.
2025-02-20T21:46:11Z,Siri has onscreen awareness already? I thought that was 18.4 feature
2025-02-21T01:48:43Z,"No, that is a different feature. The one they are talking about is more or less a screenshot then through chatGPT."
2025-02-21T02:46:23Z,Kinda like screenshot. You just activate Siri on any screen and ask whatever you want and it'll send the screenshot to ChatGPT for answers.
2025-02-21T02:47:37Z,Right exactly!
2025-02-20T21:54:22Z,"They also need to bring 3D audio, stereo recording, wind noise reduction, and audio mixing‚Äî all missing from the 15 Pro series atm."
2025-02-21T10:48:53Z,16 series have newer and significantly bigger microphone modules as per teardowns though
2025-02-20T22:13:16Z,It should already have stereo recording; perhaps you meant Spatial Audio.
2025-02-20T18:57:12Z,My visual intelligence never works since Apple intelligence rarely works when vpn is on.
2025-02-20T17:46:14Z,Why now one might ask my cynical theory is this buys them some small amount of good will as all the other ai features are silently delayed???
2025-02-20T18:57:28Z,"Not for 16 owners‚Ä¶

As a 15pm owner Im happy, but that there‚Äôs not going to be advertised features for the 16 makes me surprised no ones getting litigational"
2025-02-20T20:19:11Z,I‚Äôm sure they will if features do end up scrapped or officially delayed to ios19

They're a trillion dollar company, with one of the most expensive devices available on the market, it should be expected to hold them to the highest standard. A spelling mistake is unacceptable."

2025-02-20T18:30:31Z,"&gt; the quote actually comes from Kristian Valen making fun of Petter Solberg

That clip you posted is from 2012, but [here is a forum post](https://www.diskusjon.no/topic/1078446-its-not-the-fart-that-kills-you-its-the-smell-filmen/) attributing this quote to Solberg in 2009. That said even in this post people are saying the quote predates Solberg or is just a parody and no one could provide any clip of him saying it. 

So yes it would appear that its not actually Solberg that has said it, however, the phrase itself is still very much ""real"" (as in it is used as a joke/pun to this day), so the myth is only that Solberg popularised it."

2025-02-22T03:13:55Z,My M1 MBP is the best hardware device I‚Äôve ever owned. It‚Äôs just such a great laptop
2025-02-21T12:57:26Z,"I mean, from a tech enthusiast perspective I'd love to upgrade simply because ""new shiny tech!"", but I just can't justify it from any other perspective. On my work M1 air I do general office type work mostly, with some audio editing, Photoshop work and basic video editing in premiere as the minority workload. And I just never feel hardware restricted (that being said, I don't edit video in 4K usually - since I don't do production edits, but more timing and narrative sketching). On my personal M2 Air I run my home studio for music production, and on that one with lots of concurrent low latency real-time plugins (guitar Amp simulators etc) it just takes it and keeps going. And for either one I'm quite happy with pushing just one external 4K screen at 60hz. I prefer a dense high-PPI (running at native res without scaling) interface rather than spreading out over multiple monitors. I used to run three external monitors when their respective resolutions were lower (1080p), but I was after the screen real-estate in pure pixels rather than in display size., so as 1440p and then 4k became available I eventually scaled down to just one external monitor.

My only complaints really after four years are that on the few occasions that I need to spin up a Windows VM, it feels quite sluggish to only have 8gb of ram assigned to it - other than that, the 16gb M1 is fine. And I would have liked a right side thunderbolt port even on the air, but it's not as big if a deal for me to go for a pro just for that."
2025-02-21T15:25:39Z,"The base 14"" m1 pro was a great machine, got my best buy open box 1 year after release for $1200 I think.   The main thing that's lacking is ai image generation for me, stable diffusion, but that's still slow on the m4 stuff compared to my PC anyway."
2025-02-21T18:20:23Z,"Your scenario sounds very relatable. 

I have the base spec MacBook Air M1 and I‚Äôve edited multiple 4K videos in Final Cut Pro. Nothing professional, just holiday movies and family gatherings.

It could probably be smoother if I had more than 8 GB of RAM‚Ä¶ but honestly everything was working smooth already and exporting was quick.

This is likely why your phone dies quicker after an update. Apple says this in the Battery section of settings when it occurs and what to expect¬†

&gt; Because you just installed the OS, everything is new. That means the index is 100% not current, so the whole thing must be built. It only takes a lot of time to build the original index; after it's done the updates will only take a few seconds [when a single new file is added]. I also find that the time estimates can be way off. You might look at it again in an hour and by then might only say ""3 hours"" or even less.

Integrated GPUs from AMD and Intel have not had dozens of hundreds of GB to work with. Your foolish comparison demonstrates you only see keywords, not cully understanding the concept between each chip. Even AMD‚Äôs AI ryzen whatever the hell it is called that they just launched, while it does technically provide a large pool of LPDDR to the chip, Windows itself and the apps have to be written to take advantage of it. Thus, you still end up with performance losses and efficiency problems.¬†

A single few GB carve out for the iGPU in certain circumstances providing zero copy is not the same as engineering the entire chip, OS, APIs, and apps around a large pool of memory for CPU, GPU, and NPU providing zero copy.

I think some looking harshly at this and brushing it off as useless are ""coping"". I can't even think of a time where a benchmark ahead of an imminent launch was way off the mark?

BUT please hear me out here; there's a silver lining to this result.

Yes, it's normal and understandable that a Macbook Air will throttle. It's fanless, after all. It doesn't work under the same premises as a Macbook Pro, iMac or a Mac mini. _However_ the performance increase of the M4 is also so much that this 5% shortage in OpenCL &amp; Metal should still far surpass the M3 performance. The M4 performs roughly 25% better than the M3 in this particular benchmark.

Besides, this is a synthetic and not actual use result, and that is _not_ cope. It's just an innate limitation of benchmarks at large that they don't test your actual use; they test a CPU + GPU being hammered for some time.

Importantly in this case, actual use don't tend to hammer your hardware other than for limited periods of time, in which time they also usually don't have time to get too hot and throttled.

Summarized I think by far most people buying Macbook Air M4 will have their expectations met. If there's a temperature concern I'd have, it'd be about it feeling hot on your lap or not, not whether throttling will noticeably impact typical use."

The issue is that when we open the family settings on his iPad his name is wrong. It lists the first names/nicknames of all family members. In our case it shows his sister's name and age, my nickname ""Mom"" as organizer, and then he is also listed as ""Mom (me).""

I can't figure out how to fix this. I double checked in his apple account that everything was correct. He has no phone number associated with his apple account, and it's his email in there. I don't understand how apple is still linking him with my apple account/nickname.

I reset his iPad and pulled nothing in from the cloud, thinking maybe that was the issue. Didn't work. I went into my organizer profile on both PC and my iPhone and I just don't see where this is coming from.

Any advice?"
2025-02-21T18:10:21Z,Is the MacBook Air with an M1 chip worth buying this year?
2025-02-21T19:01:21Z,"Yes; even though it‚Äôs about 4.5 years old, it‚Äôs still not obsolete yet.

I currently have an iPhone 13 Pro with a slightly shit battery life. Comparing 16e and 16 as my next move."

2025-02-21T22:04:51Z,"No, but there are many repair businesses around now that specialize in fixing damaged iPhones. Unless you live in a small town, you should be able to find one easily.

2025-02-21T22:36:50Z,"I have an iPhone 8, and would like to finally upgrade to a newer phone. Before it became the iPhone 16e, I thought we‚Äôd see a new iteration of the iPhone SE and was planning on getting it. Now that I see some of the missing features that I think would be useful for me, I‚Äôm not going to bother.

I‚Äôm not a fan of the Dynamic Island but am OK with the notch. My current storage is 256GB and I am just over 155GB of that. I also re-subscribed to Apple Music and plan on downloading more albums. I take video, of lesson demos from dance classes, and sometimes I take pictures. I‚Äôd love a longer battery life. I‚Äôm OK with a refurbished phone.

What iPhone would you recommend to upgrade to?"
2025-02-22T00:11:18Z,"iPhone 16 Pro or Pro Max.

Though, really, I think the 16e will be just fine, unless the lack of mmWave or MagSafe support is an absolute deal killer."

2025-02-22T00:34:29Z,"The 14 is no longer on sale, so any that you see are either used, refurbished, or on clearance. I wouldn‚Äôt get one, anyway, because that was the last iPhone to use Lightning instead of USB-C for data and charging."

I did some research and found an [apple support page](https://support.apple.com/en-au/102766) which outlines the recommended router settings, so I made the adjustments but it did not help.

I'm not an apple person so I'm not particularly familiar with the products but have above general understanding of IT and networks.

I need to use an iPhone for work and my partner uses an iPhone and MacBook and these devices will connect to the router (TP-Link Archer AX6000) but not to the internet. I have plenty of other non-apple devices on this network that have no issue at all. 
Internet works on the mobile network on the phones and when hot spotting the laptop.

Restarting the router does not help.
There are no IP address conflicts and reserving addresses to these devices does not help.
Restarting the devices does not help.
Restarting the network adapter does not help.
The devices are all running the latest operating system updates.

Some reading suggested pressing the 'Renew DHCP Lease' button on the laptop, which worked once, but two days later the issue was back and now pressing the same button does not work.

Is this common for Apple products?
What is causing this issue? How can we resolve it?
Any help is appreciated."

2025-02-20T14:21:30Z,"Downvote all you want but at the end of the day Apple is a business and not a charity. They will raise the price and they won't bat an eye. Even if they are granted an exception of tariffs, they will raise prices. This ain't a prediction, it's a god damned spoiler."
2025-02-20T21:14:11Z,"The new iPhone 16e likely already has the cost of tariffs built into to its base pricing. 

I personally expect all future product announcements to have price increases."
2025-02-22T15:23:46Z,"For EU consumer worst part is that it means  also price spike there too, because why not? Apple already treats us very unfair and using exchange rate significantly higher than market rate."
2025-02-20T15:14:48Z,"Every single reputable economist out there screamed at us nonstop before the election that tariffs are inflationary and raise consumer prices and now inflation is going up again and price increases on all sorts of things are on the way.

No company is just going to absorb a new 10% tax without raising prices. No company exempt from import tax is going see that their non-exempt competitors suddenly have to charge 10% more than they did before and not raise their prices to at least just under 10% more. And it‚Äôs still more profitable for them to make their products overseas where they can exploit cheap labor forces and foreign government subsidized infrastructure that do not exist domestically anyway.

It‚Äôs all so goddamn obvious and tariffs like this administration is doing have been tried so many times in so many different ways in so many places and it always ends up worse for consumers, worse for business and worse for the economy."
2025-02-20T18:56:01Z,Not upset at Apple at all. I'm instead upset at the clown in the WH since its his doing lol.
2025-02-20T14:35:40Z,God damn you with your logic and reasoning.  Apple owes me a phone at a discount because everything is just so expensive now.  /s
2025-02-21T03:36:22Z,Best bet is to go somewhere else in the world that won‚Äôt be affected by Trump‚Äôs import taxes on these goods. A drive across the border will do you well.
2025-02-20T15:30:14Z,"they've been pretty resilient about not raising prices too much (at least in the US). I think the last major price increase we saw was the iPhone X? and maybe they increased the base model with storage on one of the higher end models one cycle. but there have also been rumors of price increases before that surprisingly never panned out.

apple knows people are price sensitive right now and they are not immune to demand fluctuations when phones can last years now. I doubt they will raise prices much if at all if they aren't forced to by tariffs."
2025-02-22T15:22:26Z,"&gt;Even if they are granted an exception of tariffs

Dunno what is worse - tariffs or granting exceptions to megacorporations."
2025-02-20T16:25:00Z,"Apple has absorbed price increases before, and apparently are currently. Hopefully they can offset a little bit"

2025-02-20T16:40:35Z,"The last time there were tariffs? Coupled with the fact that current gen iPhone has started at $999 since iPhone X despite multiple additions of technology. Mac mini has decreased in price despite new features, design, cost increases from TSMC. Current MacBooks unlike Acer or Asus or whatever

¬†A few examples"
2025-02-21T14:32:28Z,"Could you give a source on Apple's cost to make a iPhone or Mac Mini? You're saying they are absorbing increased costs but I would bet they are getting more efficient at manufacturing and profit margins are staying the same, if not growing."
2025-02-20T16:46:40Z,"Apple was exempt from tariffs the last time. 

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/23/technology/apple-watch-tariffs.html

The article says apple watch on the headline but it says ""Some of its most lucrative products, including the iPhone, iPad and MacBook, weren‚Äôt subject to the tariffs even though large swaths of imported goods from China were."""
2025-02-20T16:55:39Z,"Uh yeah, correct. They negotiated in interest of their customers.

Not trolling, why did you ignore the rest of my comment?"
2025-02-20T17:14:05Z,"You know something, you're right I didn't address the last example about the Mac mini and the iPhone X. And those examples were right on the money. 

Still, I believe we will get a price increase across the board in iPhone , iPad, Airpods Pro 3, etc (hopefully I will eat my words). Corporations/Stock Holders want to make money above all. They will squeeze the consumer for every penny they can. And we are in the middle of a perfect storm to accommodate those price increase."
2025-02-21T03:39:56Z,I don‚Äôt think anybody is blaming Apple for this bullshit.
2025-02-22T06:50:09Z,Ok Paul Heyman...
2025-02-20T16:25:22Z,"I'm not saying they won't, but its not a forgone conclusion that they will. 

Apple products are not commodities. Prices don't fluctuate with the cost of inputs because they are primarily value priced. Apple has historically liked to keep price points consistent. They aren't the only ones, Costco hotdogs, for example."
2025-02-20T14:32:22Z,"Supply and demand‚Ä¶ If phone prices go up, are people going to give up getting new phones? Doubtful.

Prices would need to go up a lot more than $100 before people actually start rethinking if they need a new phone."
2025-02-20T22:00:02Z,"I don't think phones are a totally inelastic good. If the price goes up, people might decide to get a less expensive phone, delay their purchase, or switch to a cheaper brand or model."
2025-02-21T11:02:30Z,"&gt;	switch to a cheaper brand

Familiarity, brand loyalty and vendor lock-in probably reduce this factor by a lot, but people might start eyeing budget models, and keeping them for longer."
2025-02-21T14:35:23Z,"This isn't a binary decision. People can delay a purchase, choose a cheaper model, move to another vendor etc. All of these options would impact Apple's bottom line."
2025-02-20T21:03:52Z,"Or you don't buy American products like iPhone... Apple gave money for his inauguration, Cook stood by him for the inauguration, they renamed the Gulf of Mexico...

2025-02-23T05:12:56Z,"The only country worried with China or the CCP is yours, the US. Most other countries already have a strong relationship with China.

People in other countries really don‚Äôt care using chinese mobile phone brands.

I have an iPhone but I love Xiaomi products, they are even more present than Apple here in South America as they products launches at the same day they are launched in China and they give you a watch or wireless headphones as gifts of pre-purchase. People use more Xiaomi than Samsung nowadays.

Latin America for Apple is Brazil and Mexico.

My partner mocked me for buying an iPhone 15 when he got his Mi 14T at half the price, it came with a fast charger and a sillicone case, and he got the latest Mi Smart Band as a gift because the 14T was just released in UY.

I bought the iPhone 15, so I got a 60hz screen, 256GB of storage, usb 2.0, a non-Leica cam, a fancy cable and a sticker‚Ä¶ for double the price."

2025-02-20T14:02:35Z,"As evidenced by the 16E price gouging. They're gonna raise prices on the iPhone 17 series. I guarantee that. I can totally see them raise each model by $100 or more. Hell, I can see them removing the charging cable from the box to squeeze $30 more from customers. I see the models pricing like this: 

iPhone 17 (128GB): $899

iPhone 17 Air (128GB): $999

iPhone 17 Pro (256 GB): $1,199

iPhone 17 Pro Max (256GB): $1,299 or $1,349


Edit: added some words"
2025-02-20T17:46:07Z,"You‚Äôre being downvoted but if Apple does increase the prices of next year‚Äôs phones, the 16e price point would make a lot more sense."

2025-02-20T19:41:05Z,"A 9% hit from tariffs would mean making $115B vs the $126B the previous year. 

That big of a drop would have a huge impact on the stock price, which means millions of Americans lose part of their retirement savings and have to work a few more years."
2025-02-20T19:48:05Z,"That $126 billion is not per year, it‚Äôs per quarter. Every 3 months. That is enough money. Nobody needs more than that, especially when so many customers can‚Äôt even afford the product and have to rely on subsidies through their service providers to get one. 

Anyone who believes there is no such thing as enough money and you always need more is completely fucking full of horseshit. You keep telling them it‚Äôs ok though, and they will gladly keep raising the prices."
2025-02-20T20:08:53Z,"No corporation is going to voluntarily reduce profits to make customers happy. Their responsibility is to the shareholders who invested their money with the expectation of a return on that investment. Since most of those shares are held by institutions like retirement funds, a reduction in value would have a detrimental effect on millions of retirees and hard-working Americans. 

It‚Äôs not just fat cats sitting on piles of money, it‚Äôs teachers and tradesmen and factory workers that suffer. 

If you want to be mad at someone, maybe pick the lone individual behind the need for a price increase in the first place."

2025-02-21T14:38:59Z,Okay? Welcome to capitalism which is the world that Apple operates in.
2025-02-21T16:29:12Z,My point exactly. If people don‚Äôt buy something Apple will pivot. Their only motivation is money.
2025-02-21T22:32:27Z,"&gt;If people don‚Äôt buy something Apple will pivot.

Yes, they will pivot to just not making that product anymore. Like iPod Hi-Fi, for example. Or the G4 Cube. Sometimes they'll come out with something that can be seen as a spiritual successor, but oftentimes they just stop making it. As opposed to building it somewhere else so it's cheaper.

We'll see if this is the case with Vision Pro."
2025-02-21T22:31:05Z,"Which is why the whole ""bring jobs back to America/make stuff in America"" won't work. It never does. Americans have proven time and time again what matters to them is the price, and nothing more. Every time you give them the more expensive option that's made in America, it never sells as well.

In other words, it's just a meaningless buzz phrase politicians leap onto to retain power."
2025-02-20T21:09:41Z,A 10% price increase would simply add another year or two to the upgrade cycle.no big. ü§î

2025-02-21T08:20:23Z,"When people say ‚Äúof course they‚Äôll raise the price 25%‚Äù they forget that competition keeps this in check. You can raise the price, but the outcome might be dramatically reduced demand. Phones are more of a need, so consumers might accept it and pay it, but MacBooks, iPads, headphones, etc. are all more of a ‚Äúwant‚Äù and there are all lower priced alternatives people would turn to if Apple goes too far with price increases. Competition and demand seem to be getting lost in all these tariff arguments."

2025-02-20T02:19:11Z,"Apple also still sells the external disc drive that was launched alongside the Macbook Air, they also still technically sell [first generation Macbook MagSafe chargers](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MC556LL/B/apple-85w-magsafe-power-adapter-for-15-and-17-inch-macbook-pro?fnode=3ae5a765bb97f92176c8526268dfe4a27c6e3a20604118f9f993adfc31bfd37da68d4bed16d29f54acac4c5a33c79191ce3b2a795976f95b10bd42c2a94d3cafa1d7af84a9752d69d328f45cb903607aac161e8625c35ee2ff33a322d1591288), which are nearing 2 decades old, though they're only available in Apple Stores that still have stock. MagSafe 2 still have stock though."
2025-02-20T06:37:58Z,"The SuperDrive is no longer sold by Apple. Maybe there‚Äôs stock left somewhere in the world, but it‚Äôs no longer listed on Apple US store. Indian store lists it but unavailable."
2025-02-19T16:22:33Z,how do I update the firmware???
2025-02-19T19:35:20Z,It‚Äôs a soft wear update.
2025-02-20T01:35:04Z,"I don‚Äôt get it, is it essential?"
2025-02-20T06:38:32Z,Get out.
2025-02-19T22:48:14Z,It‚Äôs hurts me how that sounds the same.
2025-02-20T05:55:54Z,You win üòÇ
2025-02-19T17:11:20Z,You don‚Äôt buy a new one each year? Am I doing it wrong?
2025-02-19T23:15:07Z,"Yeah, you need to buy a new one every time you use it. What are you, poor, reusing it?"
2025-02-20T01:45:06Z,Probably washes their own dishes after cooking their own meal for themself.
2025-02-20T10:15:53Z,Yikes. Disgusting indeed.
2025-02-20T14:11:05Z,Peasant
2025-02-20T02:00:41Z,Yes. It‚Äôs single use
2025-02-19T17:47:42Z,Is it the update that enables Apple Intelligence on the cloth?
2025-02-19T19:00:48Z,You have to get the Polishing Cloth-e to have Apple Intelligence.
2025-02-19T17:15:01Z,Connect it via MagCloth
2025-02-19T22:39:39Z,But there‚Äôs no MagSafe on the 16e üò≠

2025-02-19T19:24:37Z,That‚Äôs the one.
2025-02-19T19:03:00Z,"Need to bring it to the Apple Store so they can ""patch"" it."
2025-02-20T00:32:50Z,"Just lay the cloth near the phone, if Bluetooth and WiFi are on, it will eventually update. May take up to 20 minutes.

Or you can take your cloth to the Apple Store and a Genius will do it for you."
2025-02-19T21:31:51Z,Fold it firmly
2025-02-19T17:57:17Z,"You need to attach it via MagSafe to update‚Ä¶ oh wait the iPhone 16e doesn‚Äôt have MagSafe.

You‚Äôll have to do a mail in repair."
2025-02-19T22:13:52Z,"They can do it at the Apple store for $1 less than the cost of a new cloth. They'll hit you with their repair slogan, though: ""but at that price, you might as well buy a new one!"""
2025-02-19T16:40:05Z,"Sorry guys, I‚Äôm still waiting for Polishing Cloth Pro."
2025-02-19T17:06:07Z,"Be careful, I heard the Pro is difficult with any repairs!"
2025-02-19T16:49:29Z,Wait til the polishing cloth pro max!
2025-02-19T19:01:20Z,That‚Äôs just a blanket.
2025-02-20T00:00:49Z,Shut up and take my money
2025-02-19T17:15:52Z,I wish they release ultra version for Mac Studio
2025-02-19T16:46:19Z,For Pro you‚Äôd need Pro-tection from micro organisms.
2025-02-20T02:52:23Z,What‚Äôs next? Polishing Cloth Pro Max? Polishing Cloth Ultra? Polishing Cloth Air? Polishing Cloth e?
2025-02-19T17:12:18Z,"I‚Äôm holding out for the Max, just in case I want to take a nap at my desk"
2025-02-19T16:36:43Z,Can i jailbreak it to clean my iPhone2G?
2025-02-19T17:04:39Z,"While technically possible, it is not recommended for it can possibly cause some unwanted bugs to appear.
Yours truly, Apple support."
2025-02-19T17:13:42Z,"Ah i see i see, then ill just have to leave my iPhone 2G uncleaned"
2025-02-20T12:57:35Z,Is iPhone 2G the first iPhone?
2025-02-20T15:27:17Z,"It wasn‚Äôt called that when it launched, but yes. It was the only one that only supported 2G (GPRS and EDGE) wireless radio frequencies; 3G wireless was already out in Asia and Europe, but the American phone companies were dragging their feet on implementing it until the iPhone came out."
2025-02-19T16:22:48Z,"Can‚Äôt innovate anymore, my ass"
2025-02-19T16:41:45Z,"And no price increase either, God tier update"
2025-02-19T20:42:27Z,Praise Tim Apple.
2025-02-20T03:51:41Z,Courage.
2025-02-19T16:37:16Z,"I would‚Äôve expected Apple to release the Apple Polishing Cloth 2 by now, but I‚Äôm pleasantly surprised that they keep this amazing piece of cloth compatible with their modern devices."
2025-02-20T03:34:48Z,Its hard work to make the Apple Polishing Cloth both thinner and smaller than the current generation.  Lots of R&amp;D needed to make that happen.
2025-02-19T16:33:37Z,Finally a reason to buy the iPhone 16e
2025-02-19T22:52:25Z,"You killed me. Truly your vision is what we need today. 

ü§£ü§£ü§£"
2025-02-19T17:25:04Z,"For all the shit Apple gets about planned obsolescence, the length of its support for this product is really impressive."
2025-02-19T17:48:19Z,I‚Äôll never get tired of these
2025-02-20T00:34:00Z,"Agreed. Every time it comes up, I laugh!!"
2025-02-20T09:10:19Z,"I just want to know whose job it is to update this. This seems like a very specific product that has such treatment for product support. It's almost like among the long checklist of legal/compliance/marketing requirements when they launch a product there's a tiny checkmark that says ""update polish cloth support list"" and it's like this one unsung hero's job to do this every time."
2025-02-20T12:31:48Z,It‚Äôs my dream job
2025-02-20T14:50:04Z,"I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs so it gets listed as an accessory when shopping for phones, so not that special. It‚Äôs just funny they list it on the website."
2025-02-19T18:58:49Z,"My Polishing Cloth's microfiber count significantly dropped after they announced the 16e, anyone else experience this???"
2025-02-20T14:02:49Z,That's just the polishing cloth upgrading itself to be thinner and lighter over time.
2025-02-19T17:47:37Z,Sadly still no support for any model older than the iPhone 5.
2025-02-19T21:35:00Z,"That's because they want to force iPhone 4 users to upgrade, the greedy bastards"
2025-02-19T20:49:29Z,Really? How are we suppose to clean our devices ffs!? *Thanks a lot* Tim Apple.
2025-02-19T19:29:51Z,How do I remove the beta from my polish cloth. Deleted the profile and restarted but the update isn‚Äôt showing for me.
2025-02-19T20:51:11Z,Have you checked the polish subreddit?
2025-02-19T20:06:32Z,Does anyone know where I can get one that works for my iPhone 4S?
2025-02-20T04:25:24Z,I hope the EU forces Apple to allow these polishing cloths to work with Android.  This closed ecosystem is unacceptable.
2025-02-19T16:33:22Z,One more thing
2025-02-20T01:19:45Z,Doing the Lord‚Äôs work. Thank you for this crucial update.
2025-02-19T16:43:31Z,I hope they also add support for non-Apple devices in the next firmware update.
2025-02-19T16:27:53Z,Without an OTA update or anything??? Dang
2025-02-19T17:44:13Z,And we think that you are going to love it
2025-02-19T18:58:38Z,I‚Äôm disappointed this doesn‚Äôt have further backwards compatibility. I tried using it on my iPhone 4 once and bricked it.
2025-02-19T19:54:15Z,"I actually bought this because I thought it would be funny, but also it's a very nice polishing cloth."
2025-02-20T13:05:43Z,"That‚Äôs right, folks, it‚Äôs time to get excited about the ALL NEW polishing cloth, now with full support for the ALL NEW iPhone 16e, the first iPhone with a breakthrough C- chip! This takes things to a whole new level!"
2025-02-19T16:39:10Z,"Thank goodness, I was worried."
2025-02-19T18:19:37Z,Who needs MagSafe when you have polishing cloth compatibility?
2025-02-19T19:24:12Z,Polish clothing gets updates more often than Samsung phones /s
2025-02-19T21:08:13Z,"Honestly, the ones I met usually just wear Adidas tracksuits and sneakers all year round‚Ä¶"
2025-02-19T22:37:27Z,Apple playing to the meme is kinda funny
2025-02-20T01:14:50Z,This is the update I was waiting for
2025-02-20T01:52:44Z,Best Apple news of the day.
2025-02-19T19:49:08Z,"If you're going to buy $200 castor wheels for your Mac, then you may was well get the polishing cloth for your iphone. Go all in."
2025-02-19T19:49:15Z,By and far the most supported Apple product
2025-02-19T20:05:33Z,Still waiting for that Apple TV compatibility
2025-02-19T22:37:48Z,Dust works‚Ñ¢
2025-02-19T22:51:42Z,iPhone 4 users are SOL

2025-02-20T05:33:52Z,I‚Äôve got AppleCare on my polishing cloth.
2025-02-20T05:40:03Z,This gotta be Apple inside joke at this point lol
2025-02-19T16:42:51Z,This is a clear signal to me that new iPhones in september will get a price bump too  ü•∫
2025-02-19T17:26:11Z,I think you might be right. They might even be releasing this with the intention of adjusting consumer price concepts and soften the blow on the cash cow release so there's less negative sentiment.
2025-02-19T20:12:23Z,Also it‚Äôs likely for the tariff prices included. This might be way it got delayed a week.
2025-02-19T23:49:52Z,"Apple tends to avoid these tariffs somehow. They did last time he was in office. Which is ironic because he said the whole point is to bring jobs here, and the richest company in the world gets a pass lol"
2025-02-20T00:27:52Z,"I read today that Apple is absorbing the cost of the tariffs on their devices currently. 

Unless the government gives them a specific exemption there is no avoiding tariffs. 

Many companies will absorb the costs and then raise prices down the road."
2025-02-20T01:07:17Z,"It still seems counterintuitive for trump to do this. 

1. Make tariffs to push companies to produce in America 

2. Companies absorb costs before raising them eventually. 

3. We pay more money and have no new jobs because corporations didn‚Äôt move production here."
2025-02-20T01:30:22Z,"I dont want to get too political, but when you ""hire"" a person to run the country who has bankrupted a casino he owned, thats all you really should know about why it being counterintuitive doesnt matter.

There's a bigger picture going on here - too many of us are getting overwhelmed by the EO's being issued and are missing out on the larger picture."
2025-02-20T03:31:08Z,"Many of my friends are so exhausted from the past eight years that they avoid the news whenever possible. I do my best to keep them updated on current events while emphasizing that compliance equals obedience.

The reason you have the life you do is because of your government. It‚Äôs counterproductive to say you‚Äôre too busy making money to educate yourself about the laws that enable you to work in the first place. Similarly, people complain about big tech‚Äôs greed, yet those same individuals will spend hours on their phones scrolling through social media instead of reading the news.

I‚Äôm sorry for the rant. But yes, the bigger picture is so important. All of this is designed to confuse us, make us give up, and ultimately lead to a mindset of ‚Äúwhatever.‚Äù I strive to ensure that whoever I‚Äôm talking to really understands this. It‚Äôs disheartening to see our nation so divided, especially as someone in their mid-20s."
2025-02-19T16:45:42Z,"Yep, I‚Äôm expecting the 256GB 17 Pro Max to be like $1400 now ü´†"
2025-02-19T18:02:11Z,"It already does in Europe, around 1500‚Ç¨"
2025-02-19T19:32:22Z,Almost 1600 euro in Sweden üëçüèª
2025-02-19T18:18:26Z,"They could because of tariffs, but I don't know, this doesn't necessarily mean that to me.

It's $600 compared to $800, but:

 * is missing a second camera
 * has a worse screen
 * is missing dynamic island
 * has a binned SoC
 * is missing MagSafe
 * has slower charging
 * (edit) has no camera control

And I'm sure some other things I'm missing.  Add all these up and it seems $200 is reasonable."
2025-02-19T21:43:03Z,"It has an OLED screen, native 5G modem for improved battery life and USB-C, that‚Äôs all that matters tbf for an entry level phone.

I really don‚Äôt think they should‚Äôve software capped the display, it‚Äôs probably the exact same part as the one used to assemble a 16."
2025-02-19T16:07:28Z,"Uhhh is this phone not compatible with MagSafe?

2025-02-19T16:10:27Z,What a bizarre place to cost cut
2025-02-19T19:15:32Z,"The thing has an OLED and an action button, but no MagSafe lol"
2025-02-19T21:19:16Z,No new camera button either‚Ä¶ and the action button doesn‚Äôt cost them extra
2025-02-19T17:38:46Z,"It‚Äôs probably to act as a differentiator, not as a cost cutter"
2025-02-19T18:03:59Z,"Purposefully abandoning more revenue on accessories seems dumb for Apple. Or they know people will put a case on it anyway, so still a cost cutter."
2025-02-19T19:34:19Z,"it's also possible that the removal of magsafe makes it less appealing for people who want to go cheaper, keep the customers paying more. probably won't make a difference in usage since magsafe cases exist, but it's the psychology of losing something. and the people who don't use cases."
2025-02-19T16:08:28Z,OOF
2025-02-19T16:10:14Z,What a swing and a miss. And more expensive than anticipated. Yikes.
2025-02-19T16:34:14Z,They‚Äôre gonna sell like hotcakes
2025-02-19T16:41:25Z,"They absolutely are, especially to older adults looking for something somewhat simple to use so they can use FaceTime and budget-conscious parents looking for their kid's first smartphone."
2025-02-19T17:43:40Z,"Absolutely.

For many people, an iPhone is an iPhone.

Add in the inflationary period we're living in, people are looking to cut corners on costs everywhere."
2025-02-19T16:11:41Z,This is the most insane part to me
2025-02-19T16:08:49Z,Cutting where they can

2025-02-19T18:15:55Z,Hey! Don't say that. - Tim Apple
2025-02-19T16:03:38Z,"Has their own modem mow

‚ÄúExpanding the benefits of Apple silicon, C1 is the first modem designed by Apple and the most power-efficient modem ever on an iPhone, delivering fast and reliable 5G cellular connectivity. Apple silicon ‚Äî including C1 ‚Äî the all-new internal design, and the advanced power management of iOS 18 all contribute to extraordinary battery life.‚Äù"
2025-02-19T16:11:20Z,"Cannot wait to see the Qualcomm vs Apple modem comparisons üòÇüòÇüòÇ

First time Qualcomm had entered the consumer conscious"
2025-02-19T16:43:09Z,"Modems are hard. I remember the intel modem they used for the iPhone XS‚Ä¶it was not good. But Apple has to take a step forward somewhere, so this seems like a good starting point."
2025-02-19T17:09:44Z,Part of the issue is the insane patents on modems. You basically have to invent a completely new way of doing a standardized thing. Which it turns out that there are a finite number of good ways to do any given thing
2025-02-19T17:45:21Z,How is that patented but things like bluetooth are open standards?
2025-02-19T18:39:03Z,"Both standards are open. Anyone can go read the 5G standard and BT tech is still patented just like cell modems. But BT tech is patented by the Bluetooth special interests group (SIG). A bunch of companies came together with the explicit goal of making an open system so that all BT products would be compatible. Since BT is decentralized, they needed that collaboration for their products to be viable. You can't have each company with their own ""BT network"". Customers wouldn't buy into that. So SIG developed and patented the tech, and then licences that out to anyone who wants to make their own BT device. 

The main difference with cell is that it's way more difficult (expensive) and there's only a few cell networks in every country (centralized). So the incentives flip. Instead of it being more profitable to work together on licencing. Its more profitable to beat everyone else to the punch, patent your tech, and make them pay you to license it (or don't license it at all in a vertical company like Apple) 

TLDR: BT is decentralized and all BT devices needed to be compatible. But cell is centralized. Qualcomm's cell modems don't need to be compatible with Apple's and vice versa. So there's no incentive to collaborate"
2025-02-19T18:06:59Z,"Two separate things. Standards means you have to meet certain specifications to have things work with others, while the way of achieving such specifications can be patented. For example, Apple actually did patent the way that make true wireless headphones work (by sharing keys, the second headphone was actually tapping into the other one‚Äôs signal) so initially AirPods were the only true wireless headphones. Later on people find ways to do similar stuff without using the way that was patented by Apple so now it‚Äôs everywhere. Also, standards could just mean something that the majority of the big players in that industry agreed on, they could already have agreements on licensing."
2025-02-19T16:21:39Z,I expect Qualcomm to still win in a head-to-head comparison. But I imagine the C1 is still good enough for all normal usage. And it gives Apple a chance to work out issues with it in a lower volume product.
2025-02-19T16:12:00Z,"While I won't be buying a 16e, I give my congrats to whatever team that finally got that modem shipped. Sounds like it's been quite the struggle."
2025-02-19T16:25:18Z,"There's likely a reason why they are debuting their modem on the cheapest product and not on the Pro models.

I doubt the performance will be the same."
2025-02-19T16:11:23Z,"This is huge. I still won‚Äôt buy it, but look forward to 17 pro a little more now."
2025-02-19T16:36:21Z,"Makes a lot of sense.  Apple tends to ""test"" things on smaller (and smaller is a relative term for apple) run products or lower end ones to experiment and validate technology.  Remember when the sim eject tool was using a form of Liquid Metal when apple bought them? 

I assume with these chips they will production test before rolling it out to the next higher production products.  That said I could be totally wrong and this will be in all next gen devices soon.  Depends how confident they are."
2025-02-19T16:35:42Z,Seems like it‚Äôd be way better to buy a one model old used phone for ~$500. A 15 Pro is a really good phone.
2025-02-19T16:41:01Z,15 pro over this any day this is insanely stupid pricing.
2025-02-19T21:20:51Z,Pls find me a $500 iPhone 15 pro. I'm seeing $640 on eBay for a 128GB
2025-02-19T21:51:16Z,"Not Op but only $40 more than this phone. That‚Äôs a no brainer any day of the week, I don‚Äôt care how bad a Memaw is with their phone, don‚Äôt give them this when they can have a phone with all of the capabilities including Apple Intelligence for $40 more than this thing."

2025-02-19T16:31:48Z,Well.. they also dropped the 64gb model. The rumor was $499 for a 64gb $599 for 128 etc. Essentially this lined up.
2025-02-19T17:57:44Z,That rumour makes no sense. 64 to 128 is a $50 jump on the SE and on the 12 when it was out.

Edit: and one less GPU core
Edit 2:  Copying my personal sentiment from below here - if the point is to make a low-cost-of-entry phone (especially for parents buying their kids phones, or elderly folks needing simplified devices, or a secondary phone, etc) it doesn't need all these costly bells and whistles. Should have absolutely been in a plastic form factor imo, it's fine without the camera button."
2025-02-19T16:29:17Z,"And the 16e has one less GPU core, no camera control button and no dynamic island but is the first with Apple's modem"
2025-02-19T16:36:10Z,One less GPU core as well. Check the compare page
2025-02-19T18:00:22Z,There are multiple differences beyond what you listed lmfao
2025-02-19T16:02:56Z,900 CAD that‚Äôs not affordable. People need an affordable phone and iPhone SE was that. Not anymore. lol I was waiting to buy it but the 16 is only 200 CAD more.
2025-02-19T16:04:00Z,749 ‚Ç¨ in Finland. Insane.
2025-02-19T16:33:17Z,699 ‚Ç¨ in Germany. Hmm.
2025-02-19T16:09:43Z,"Wow, it's 16990 Czk (677 eur) in Czechia, that's a substantial difference"
2025-02-19T18:05:18Z,"The price comparison must always factor in VAT, as the US prices do not include any sales tax either (even though sales tax is generally substantially lower than European VAT rates). Take the Czech price, for instance. 16990 CZK without the 21% Czech VAT is roughly 14000 CZK which is around 580 USD. So the phone is actually cheaper from Apple‚Äôs point of view in the Czech Republic than in the US. Whether it‚Äôs a reasonable price is a different question, of course."
2025-02-19T17:26:29Z,"yeah, 729 in Italy. Welp, that's a no from me. And I was gonna get it"
2025-02-19T17:21:38Z,"&gt;""the 16 is only 200 CAD more""

That's the exact trap that Apple has laid out for people like you.¬†

""Oh the regular iPhone is only 200 more...""

""Oh the larger size is only 100 more...""

""Oh the Pro is only 200 more...""

""Oh the larger size is only 100 more...""

And now you're spending $600 more than you were initially going to because Apple walked you up to the Pro Max (which is the best selling version)"
2025-02-19T16:35:48Z,"$900 plus tax, so more like $1000.

The iPhone SE was $650 with tax."
2025-02-19T16:24:52Z,"Yeah 900 CAD is insane as your starting point for an iPhone. I understand the Canadian dollar is weak right now but this needed to have better regional pricing. 

750 CAD should have been the starting point considering the 2020 SE was 580 CAD. 100$ price increase for Americans while we get the pleasure of seeing a ~300$ price increase..."
2025-02-19T16:15:40Z,$1199 in New Zealand.
2025-02-19T16:19:34Z,¬£599 in UK. Damn
2025-02-19T18:26:31Z,About ¬£100 too much to be the SE‚Äôs replacement

Apple designed C1 Modem"
2025-02-19T17:02:10Z,"The most interesting thing here. I am so curious to see how it benchmarks. And if it‚Äôs worse than Qualcomm, will they hold onto those in the Pro line at least this year? Hmm‚Ä¶"
2025-02-19T16:35:51Z,It is a release to test their C1 in the real world
2025-02-19T16:05:53Z,"Lol, in the Netherlands its almost the same price as the 16, who will buy it for that price? 16E is 719 euro, the 16 is 789 euro lol"
2025-02-19T16:20:52Z,Where in Europe does the iPhone 16 cost 789‚Ç¨? In germany it is 699‚Ç¨ for 16e and 949‚Ç¨ for 16.
2025-02-19T16:07:55Z,Exactly lol
2025-02-19T16:21:10Z,"719‚Ç¨ base, ain't no way. It confirms I will just grab a 15Pro for the USB-C."
2025-02-19T16:37:03Z,Guess this is good news for me! Was ready to upgrade to this but....will stick to my 13 mini for at least one more generation it seems.
2025-02-19T17:33:19Z,Exactly the conclusion I came to. I was ready to upgrade if this was $500 but the value proposition seems minimal at best. Happy to hold onto my mini for longer instead.
2025-02-19T18:42:17Z,Sticking with my 13 mini till they launch another mini-5.4 inch or less
2025-02-19T18:25:30Z,"Same here, I was ready to impulse buy as a 12 mini owner. But I guess I need to keep waiting."
2025-02-19T16:11:19Z,$600 USD + no magsafe lmao
2025-02-19T18:42:01Z,There are so many people making comments about how it‚Äôll sell regardless. Idgaf how it sells the fact that it‚Äôs $600 and doesn‚Äôt have a feature that would‚Äôve cost them maybe $2 to implement is crazy.
2025-02-19T16:06:13Z,"Yeah, that‚Äôs way more expensive than I was expecting. Like $200 more than I was expecting."
2025-02-19T17:35:12Z,"The lack of UWB and MagSafe is really puzzling. These have been standard features for the last 5 years.

No UWB means that one of the main features of AirTags (Precision Finding) is unavailable. It also means no support for upcoming UWB smart locks.

No MagSafe means slow 7.5W wireless charging. The new Qi2 standard (aka MagSafe - 15W + magnets) is currently all the range and anyone who buys a wireless charging dock is going to be disappointed. Yes third party cases that have the MagSafe magnets will definitely be available but you‚Äôll still be stuck with the slow charging speed.

Even if the price was cheaper like the previous iPhone SE it replaces I‚Äôd still expect these features on a new iPhone, especially in 2025."
2025-02-19T16:16:10Z,"I know it‚Äôs Apple‚Äôs big thing right now, but pushing ‚ÄúApple Intelligence‚Äù right at the top of the page isn‚Äôt a great selling point. The first thing I would do if I were to buy a new iPhone is figure out a way to get ‚Äúdumb Siri‚Äù back."
2025-02-19T16:31:36Z,"It really gives me flashbacks to when LG was pushing their ThinQ branding so hard with every phone launch. Wasn‚Äôt a fan of it then, not a fan of it now (with Apple slapping ‚Äúhello, Apple Intelligence‚Äù on every page)"
2025-02-19T16:27:48Z,Siri enhancements havent even been released yet
2025-02-19T16:15:08Z,"Cool, can we see the SE now cause this clearly isn‚Äôt it"
2025-02-19T18:35:32Z,"Too expensive, should not have been more than $100 more than old SE. Should have been $499. This is only $100 less than iPhone 16."
2025-02-19T17:05:46Z,I‚Äôm reading all of this on a 13 mini. My consensus is I‚Äôm gonna get a new battery and run this thing for another 24 months.
2025-02-19T16:12:02Z,"Fuck me, that's expensive."
2025-02-19T16:46:53Z,"If that's really what you want on your cakeday, so be it."
2025-02-19T16:19:24Z,Give us back the SE or mini.
2025-02-19T18:05:44Z,This as a mini would be amazing and I would have bought it in a second.
2025-02-19T16:39:00Z,Finally at least 128 GB base storage for this edition.
2025-02-19T16:24:25Z,"Very funny to read this thread. Reactions ranging from extreme anger to belief that it‚Äôs DOA. There is a **huge** class of consumers who fundamentally do not care about the small differences between this and the iPhone 16, and to them this is just an iPhone 16 for $200 less. It will sell like hotcakes."
2025-02-19T21:41:59Z,"I miss Product Red, it‚Äôs been years since a new iPhone came out with red, but something about that Red was so striking, and I will always be a sucker for colors on devices."
2025-02-20T04:31:08Z,"Always bugged me that it was a mid-year refresh color, rather than one available at launch (at least for the phones I got). I'd love an iPhone 16 or 17 Pro in Product Red color."
2025-02-20T17:54:21Z,"I've always assumed this was intentional as a percentage of profits go to RED, big sales at the beginning of the cycle."
2025-02-20T20:24:30Z,"Yeah, the 2 best colours (red and the dark green on the 13) came halfway through the cycle. Such a waste."
2025-02-21T23:35:25Z,+1 for the Alpine Green.
2025-02-20T20:00:39Z,"I agree. I have many iPhones, and the (PRODUCT)RED color was the most striking, gorgeous, and beautiful color on a smartphone out there and one I've ever had..ü§©ü§© Along with Midnight Green on the 11 Pro and Alpine Green on the 13 Pro."
2025-02-20T12:37:27Z,"I think it's actually important in the current slop of devices where they all look the same, they're all now a slab of glass - your colour of phone choice, or skin on your laptop or mac says a lot about you"
2025-02-19T23:14:49Z,"I just want red damnit. The charity was a bonus. 

I got the iPod nano in 2006 that was the first product red thing they made and everything that could possibly be red in between that and my iPhone 14 was.

The only one I really disliked was the almost coral red iPhone 12. 

I‚Äôd buy a bright red MacBook if they sold them."
2025-02-20T00:41:27Z,Same. I love the red on the XR and 13. I wish there were pro models in red. But my next one would be if they decide to make another red phone. Regardless of normal or pro
2025-02-20T04:11:27Z,I always get the pro but I‚Äôm hoping the Air gets the fun colors this year.
2025-02-20T15:00:08Z,Still waiting for a fleet of Air models with the iMac colors
2025-02-20T18:20:39Z,I mis midnight green. Was released with 13 and i was a year in my 2 year cycle. It was so beautiful. Shame it never returned for the Pro models.
2025-02-20T11:52:20Z,"The red on the 13 is gorgeous, too bad they hate fun"
2025-02-20T07:42:14Z,I read that as iPod bono
2025-02-20T22:45:18Z,That was the U2 iPod
2025-02-19T19:34:10Z,"I didn't realize until recent years how wide the red spectrum is. I like the deep, rich red, like the one on the last iPhone SE."
2025-02-19T21:20:40Z,"Space grey had so many different shades it‚Äôs insane, even within the same generation of devices."
2025-02-20T11:14:52Z,I like coral red
2025-02-20T15:31:10Z,It annoys me so much how Apple keeps changing what their own colors are.
2025-02-19T19:42:47Z,The (PRODUCT)^RED iPhone 8 is still the best looking iPhone I‚Äôve owned imo.
2025-02-19T21:35:04Z,Also one of the best [reveals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lE0cRa1x3Nw) imo.
2025-02-19T22:37:37Z,I agree on that! One my favourite iPhone reveals of all time.
2025-02-20T08:57:05Z,"By far the best reveal! I remember having recently gotten my iPhone X, which was the most revolutionary thing at the time, and considering trading that in for an iPhone 8 in red! Not many phones can be considered sexy, but that phone was *sexy*!"
2025-02-21T02:18:53Z,"The original Apple Watch reveal is still my favorite I think

https://youtu.be/1xIxo4ahNrA?si=9MrJlSvARVzYJTBz"
2025-02-19T23:53:20Z,iPhone 13 red was the best but iPhone 8 is close second
2025-02-20T00:33:37Z,Have to agree with you there. I got my dad a red 13 mini and it looks fantastic. I was let down by the red on the 12 mini...
2025-02-20T02:32:30Z,You mean the coral 12 mini?
2025-02-20T07:06:36Z,Big facts lol both are great but the 13 was perfect. If it had USB C I would have never upgraded to the 15 pro.
2025-02-20T02:41:28Z,It looks very similar to my se3! I got the red one thankfully and I‚Äôm keeping it.
2025-02-20T05:29:34Z,"Had one of those, absolutely amazing looking phone. Always turned heads."
2025-02-20T12:07:41Z,"It‚Äôs still my phone, I‚Äôm typing this on it right now, best looking iPhone ever made imo. I hate the bright reds and then the pale colors they started using. The red iPhone 8 is darker and more elegant."
2025-02-20T02:23:48Z,"I liked giving them money.

2025-02-20T15:34:15Z,Just getting ahead of rainbows being outlawed
2025-02-19T20:08:21Z,"I'll play devil's advocate here. I don't think them ending the (PRODUCT)RED line was due to Apple caving into the oligarchy. They haven't put out a new (P)R-line product in years. I just assume it's because the line wasn't as profitable as they had hoped-- or maybe it was in the beginning but not anymore-- so of course they'd axe it. Apple has always been in the business of making money. It‚Äôs definitely a capitalist company. It doesn't *look* good from a PR perspective (considering everything that‚Äôs going on), but I think people are thinking this is deeper than what it really is."
2025-02-19T21:40:48Z,Honestly forgot about that whole charity. It was very much a thing 10-15 years ago when Bono was pushing it but I have not seen or heard anything working with them or any advertising from them for years.
2025-02-19T22:21:18Z,"I feel like half the time the product red release was way after the initial phone release, so most people already upgraded that wanted to."
2025-02-19T22:35:03Z,"I think that was intentional, their attempt to capture more upgrades. Though for me it was often so late that I had already made a decision to upgrade or not."
2025-02-19T22:39:38Z,Also it‚Äôs an extremely bold color choice.  You have to *really* like the color red to get one.
2025-02-20T11:25:56Z,"Being so afraid of color you wind up with a gray apartment full of gray objects, of which you leave to go drive your gray car (gray interior) to work."

2025-02-20T09:21:50Z,"I don't think anyone cares about the charity, but having something that wasn't a boring black slab was cool."
2025-02-20T09:28:43Z,"I feel like it was a Steve Jobs/Jony Ive thing. Now that they‚Äôre gone, no one else feels strongly enough about it to keep it around.

Red is a polarising colour, just like with red cars. Either you love it, or you hate it. There‚Äôs no in between."
2025-02-20T00:03:52Z,"I always associated product red with Jony Ive. He also did many of the partnerships and always did the videos etc. I suspect it might have gone away with him.

But there is nothing public to make that clear. But Google product red Jony Ive and you‚Äôll see he did a lot
of stuff with them."
2025-02-20T04:51:08Z,"I always wanted a Red iPhone. But they never really put them on the pro models that I remember. If they did it was the year after I already upgraded and wasn‚Äôt gonna upgrade so soon. 

Pro models have some things I kinda need now, the high refresh rate being one of them."

Apple is a collaborator now. There's no way they'd support an AIDS foundation anymore."
2025-02-19T20:08:51Z,"The Apple Maps uses the GOV database for naming of things, just like Google, its not some agreement thing."
2025-02-19T21:11:53Z,"&gt; Apple is a collaborator now

Apple has _always_ been a collaborator. 

When China asked them to put all their user's data onto government controlled data centers what did they do?

When Russia or whoever asked them to ban VPNs?

When they supported LGBT rights, it was only on Western countries. The blocked and removed LGBT apps on countries like Saudi Arabia and China.

It's always been money first, the rest way way way after. They just pretend to have values and PR the shit out of that. 

But when money is on the line, they show their true colors.

Their gay CEO donating to Trump and attending the inauguration while he's absolutely the LGBT community should hopefully wake up some deluded people. But I'm sure they'll forget when they do their next PR campaign."
2025-02-19T22:51:44Z,"This.

Without getting too political. There are quite a lot of LGBT people who do not partake in the allyship among the majority.

Tim is absolutely one of those. The other i know is my uncle."

2025-02-19T19:54:23Z,Then you should stop buying apple products. Show them how much you disagree with them by not buying their products.
2025-02-20T03:46:42Z,They haven‚Äôt released a new Product (Red) device in years - and phone design / production cycles are measured in years - this has nothing to do with the administration (as much as I hate them)
2025-02-19T19:49:31Z,"AIDS is too woke for apple now. Next up is Tim Apple stepping down because he‚Äôs a DEI employee.

Honestly, at this point, I wouldn‚Äôt put it past Apple to start implementing back doors into ios to comply with the new regime.

Have an exit strategy. Don‚Äôt get complacent."

2025-02-19T20:12:28Z,"Alternative Android OS like Graphene. Also, if you truly value privacy/security, learning how to use linux will likely be the only way to have those two things in the next 10 years.

I‚Äôve been an apple user for a while now because I value the security and the vague nod they give towards privacy. Since all of this AI stuff, I‚Äôve been dipping my toes in the Linux world because I really don‚Äôt trust it all not turning into a overwhelming surveillance tool on orders of magnitude we cannot comprehend right now. We are entering the era of precognition."

2025-02-19T21:14:29Z,"You don't have to go anywhere, unless you want to complicate yourself too much. All major companies are about money and nothing else.

Apple is still a bit better in some regards, simply because it makes them money (e.g. privacy because they sell fewer -for now- ads than the rest).

Just don't eat up their obviously fake PR stunts and be good with it."

The Cook era Apple is ONLY about pleasing shareholders after all."

So after my (RED) iPhone 12 - i have a blue one, because I wanted a 15 pro. If that would have been (RED) I would have gotten that color. Same with my iPad Air (or the old mini - but we had the (RED) covers for them).  
Only the watch is where I personally didn't find the color useful, so I did never have a (RED) one (have Ultra 2 now, was never offered in red) and the (RED) watch bands are not really good looking except the first one.

2025-02-20T14:07:48Z,how would they get the skins in the game?
2025-02-20T14:14:54Z,"I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs actually comparable, but by arguing they should have access to the ‚ÄúFortnite market‚Äù which is monopolized by Epic to the detriment of consumers. Again, not really comparable imo (though a cheeky way to highlight what Epic is arguing for)."
2025-02-20T19:56:03Z,It‚Äôs not comparable.  Apple is accused of banning developers from linking to payments without their 30% fee.  Apple is ordered to stop doing this.   Apple did not stop.

2025-02-20T12:00:07Z,Like the iPad pro lidar!
2025-02-19T16:31:26Z,"This is the biggest news for me

I am super curious how well this C1 performs against the Qualcomm X71 that‚Äôs in the iPhone 16 series. 

I‚Äôve been super happy with the performance of Qualcomm modems in the past few iPhones and Galaxies and hope Apple has cooked up something special here (Apple Silicon M1 kind of moment?)

can‚Äôt wait for reviews"
2025-02-19T17:03:42Z,Gonna guess reviews are going to gloss over the modem after barely testing it in metropolitan areas.
2025-02-19T18:37:38Z,The modem and the battery life are about the only new things the reviewers can actually test so I suspect not
2025-02-20T01:28:04Z,Not to mention the phone lacks mmWave so there's that
2025-02-20T01:56:37Z,"I‚Äôm assuming that‚Äôs due to it being a descendant of the iPhone SE series. iPhone SE 3 had 5G but no mmWave. Also one thing I‚Äôm curious about is if iPhone 14 displays will work on it similar to how 5s displays worked on the SE 1 and vice versa, and how iPhone 8, SE 2, and SE 3 displays were interchangeable but the SE 2 and 3 lacked the 3D Touch hardware so if you used an SE screen on an 8 you lost that capability."
2025-02-20T12:54:43Z,"I think you‚Äôre overthinking it. It‚Äôs Apple‚Äôs first modem. I believe I‚Äôve heard reports of that being the hardest part of a new modem, and Apple was having trouble making it. So they left it off their base model."
2025-02-19T18:46:36Z,"Reviewer's tend to ""review"" mostly in their apartments, that just happen to have the highest end routers (gifted to them for review, of course).

VERY few reviewers test modem strength, and if they do, it's in cities with the fastest and most substantial coverage in the world.

This became abundantly clear with the last few years Pixel launches - phones that BARELY work as phones, which reviewers somehow didn't notice..."
2025-02-19T21:02:09Z,"Part of the issue is that evaluating cellular networks in the field is very complicated and requires pretty in-depth technical knowledge if you actually want a comprehensive, head-to-head comparison.

It's pretty easy for a non-technical reviewer to go off a stat sheet, run some benchmarking software, and measure how long it takes for some apps to open or perform operations.

It's much more difficult for a non-technical reviewer to understand (much less test) how a modem handles different channel fading profiles, how it handles a triggered cell reselection, how the error correction impacts performance or other very technical metrics and then communicate that to an audience. You can feasibly do throughput measurements, but modems are so much more than raw speed, and without comparable RF front ends it's hard to attribute changes in performance to a new modem or to a different design.

I suspect that a lot of review videos are going to have a ""well it's got a new modem but what does that mean?"" portion of their video."
2025-02-19T19:21:20Z,"The pixel 6-8 modems were bad, 6 especially. But the 9 modem is legitimately fine and better in some situations than Qualcomm ones."
2025-02-20T00:06:50Z,"I use a 9 pro daily. 

It's much better, but still worse than plenty of other older devices on the modem front"
2025-02-19T20:44:26Z,"I can confirm. Outside of the US at least, Google Pixel phones are horrible in terms of network connectivity with cellular towers.

Here in Sri Lanka. Pixels drop calls and messages regularly, even in the major cities like Colombo, despite us having 5G support and 4G as well.

iPhones work great with our carriers here. No issues at all. Same can be said for every other Android device as well."
2025-02-19T23:50:40Z,"Interesting. Your ‚Äúhighest end routers‚Äù comment sent me down a bit of a rabbit-hole. iPhone 16e is WiFi 6 compatible, the 16 and all other newer models are WiFi 7 compatible. So they‚Äôd get the ‚Äúnearly highest end routers.‚Äù"
2025-02-20T00:04:30Z,"I mean that tech reviewers houses are kitted out, pretty often, by ex-review 'gifts' (that likely act as a sweetener for better reviews, but that's a separate issue)

They're probably testing phones in apartments with full mesh systems (no deadspots) or the latest Netgear nighthawks - FAR from a normal person's experience.

Which is why reviewers often get better battery life in their tests - the modems are likely never searching for signal..."
2025-02-19T17:09:21Z,"Apple haven‚Äôt done this because the current modems should (or can) be improved, but because Qualcomm have been abusing FRAND patent rules and Apple wants to get away from paying them inflated costs.

This is not to be compared to the Apple M chips but to Apple Maps. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if these cellular chips work a bit less efficiently than the Qualcomm ones but that Apple are willing to take those trade-offs.

If you read about how Qualcomm are horrible patent trolls towards small businesses and inventors, you‚Äôd be very supportive of this move."
2025-02-20T00:13:58Z,"Tell that to Intel and Samsung who‚Äôve developing modems for years and they were always much worse than Qualcomm.

Current Exynos modems are actually pretty decent but Intel never released anything competitive and efficient, even with all their expertise in WiFi/Bluetooth and Ethernet (their wireless cards are prevalent and well regarded in the industry)."

2025-02-19T17:03:32Z,"Reading between the lines, this is actually the big news of the day. 

Many engineers have said that it might be near impossible to build this. I've been following the rumors for years and heard stories of how RF engineering is just impossible, with tons of weird edge cases, interference issues and unpredictable physics. A lot of modern cellular technology also builds on decades of tribal knowledge that Qualcomm has built up and although theyre meant to share some of it via FRAND licensing, many lawsuits have shown that theyre not exactly willing.

Another whole thing is getting it certified by the carriers. They were stories from Intel engineers about stuff like failing vodafone tests in europe due to obscure bug that would only occur when a user was on a call while moving between two specific cell towers in rural Spain."
2025-02-19T17:24:37Z,"Yeah and even for non apple users, competition in the 5G modem space is something we all want to be seeing."

There's a reason Apple has San Diego offices."
2025-02-19T19:27:11Z,"This is the big news. I was at Apple for 21 years. I didn‚Äôt work directly on Cert, but I was Cert-adjacent and a lot of my team members were directly involved. Certification is *a lot* and if a product fails cert, it‚Äôs a very big problem. I am super proud of the engineers and QA specialists that saw this through."
2025-02-20T04:33:44Z,"&gt;A lot of modern cellular technology also builds on decades of tribal knowledge that Qualcomm has built up   

I remember hearing or reading that, after buying Intel's modem business and finding out that they just didn't have the skills to make 5G modems, they went about hiring as many Qualcomm engineers as they could.   

Possibly that's why it's taken so long: Getting enough engineers with the skills and experience necessary to make something on this level."
2025-02-20T01:36:54Z,"My undergrad was in High-Frequency electrical engineering. Even without considering the patents minefield, the math in this field is basically a bunch of bullshit tied together by another bunch of bullshit glue, everything is an approximation of something else. When you get to the final equation, it's likely 10-20 levels deep in the approximation nightmare, and somehow magically it still works. 

And I'm not even talking about the physical shape of the antenna yet. Even with the advance of current simulator, most are still designed manually by engineers who have mastered the dark magic ..."
2025-02-20T06:39:51Z,"As a software engineer, most of these things sound like the kind of bugs you get with old often-patched never-fixed Spagetti code. (You can have that in VHDL too). People are always surprised how well a clean sheet implementation works"
2025-02-19T19:16:36Z,Why would it be impossible to build? Samsung and mediatek have already done it. Apple had also a different one with intel. The problem is they're subpar compared to qualcomm and reading rumours of this one that won't change either. This is a decision made to pay less to qualcomm and not because it's a better product
2025-02-19T20:08:27Z,"Fees and COGS is the short-term gain. Having full control and ownership of one of the most critical components in flagship product is the long-term gain. As of now, Apple can't do anything with the modem without tipping their hand to Qualcomm and effectively their competitors."
2025-02-19T23:28:06Z,"Not yet; Apple iterates and constantly improves their technology.

Qualcomm must be shitting bricks.  Not bc of the C1, but the C2, C3, etc.

Eventually the A &amp; M series chips will have the Apple modem on-chip."
2025-02-20T11:18:08Z,Is there a place I can read more about the obscure bug in rural spain?
2025-02-21T04:42:34Z,Do you have a link to the Spain bug thing I‚Äôve never heard about that before
2025-02-19T21:22:10Z,"It seems to support all of the same 5G frequency bands as the Qualcomm X71m that‚Äôs in the other iPhone 16 series devices (excluding mmWave), so it will be interesting to see how it performs."
2025-02-19T16:28:39Z,"More curious to see how this works out than the phone itself to be honest.

On the one hand, if it works no one cares (other than apples bottom line) but it‚Äôs going to be hilarious if it causes all kinds of issues."
2025-02-19T16:56:59Z,The C1 likely won‚Äôt be in the 17 series. But the C2 might be. Just depends on how much they‚Äôve learned since they started on shrinking their work.
2025-02-19T17:53:38Z,"As soon as this chip has been field-validated, I start the riots demanding they put it in Macbooks"

2025-02-19T18:56:31Z,This would be ideal
2025-02-19T21:54:06Z,"... with a $200 upcharge, of course."
2025-02-19T16:58:54Z,"I don't think the ""e"" branding will last beyond this generation, unless Apple needs to continue investing in refining the C-series chips."
2025-02-19T16:58:12Z,The C1 5G and LTE bands are listed on the technical specifications for the 16e: [iPhone 16e - Technical Specifications - Apple](https://www.apple.com/iphone-16e/specs/)
2025-02-19T21:18:38Z,Wonder what carrier aggregation it supports for sub6 and LTE
2025-02-19T16:32:04Z,"It is based on what they had from buying the Intel Modem division.

I am of course, happy. The more customized the better integrated it will be with the OS.

Maybe mobile network searching won‚Äôt take randomly forever now."
2025-02-19T18:11:08Z,How should we be determining if this is an upgrade or downgrade in every day use? Any real metrics or it‚Äôll be subjective data?
2025-02-19T18:44:40Z,"The most important metric is, does it work or not work in the place where one is usually?

The second most important metric is, does it work or not work when one goes traveling in some other place far away from here? This was a real problem 20 years ago, since North America and Europe use different frequencies for mobile phones; Qualcomm mostly solved it since then, and it‚Äôll be interesting to see if Apple solved it as well."
2025-02-20T08:53:06Z,"Not an expert, but the balance of energy consumption and reception is probably what matters the most. 

You can achieve better signal with more power, but would that be better? It depends on all other things."
2025-02-19T16:27:16Z,"I'm sure it'll work fine and get better as time goes, but it debuting on the cheapest phone they make must mean they aren't there yet in terms of competing with Qualcomm.

At least there's some competition though, even if they aren't at the highest tier yet."
2025-02-19T16:42:50Z,"Or in the event of buggy hardware, its minimally exposed in a budget product before it gets to the pro line"
2025-02-19T20:50:02Z,And it's ideal for a budget phone because it's cheaper...
2025-02-19T21:10:35Z,This. It‚Äôs a high volume seller with a higher tolerant user. These owners aren‚Äôt necessarily looking at having the best speeds on the phone with low tolerance but just something that works allows Apple to get a broad swath of data as they being to develop the modem for the 20 platform
2025-02-20T07:24:01Z,"Ding ding ding. People are looking at this all wrong. It‚Äôs in a budget phone to get it out to as many people as they can to collect data to refine it. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if every update brought new firmware to this modem refining it more and more. 

Apple is banking on in house modem integration, anyone thinking they aren‚Äôt taking it seriously just because they are putting it in the 16e is not looking at the whole picture."
2025-02-19T16:58:16Z,Could also be production constraints or having missed the deadline for iPhone 16.¬†
2025-02-19T20:11:23Z,"This is part of a long-term iterative roadmap. Start small, and kaizen it to top-tier performance and efficiency."
2025-02-19T22:09:33Z,"I wouldn't call this start small. Their SE (in this case the ""e"" now) has always been their top selling phone world wide. They probably started with the lower end because performance isn't as good yet. And people who buy the lowest end usually have lower expectations, so are more willing to deal with the issues that may come with the C1."
2025-02-19T16:45:35Z,"They only mention C1 once on the iPhone 16e page, barely going into any details on it. Usually Apple is pretty proud of their in-house chips. Strange."
2025-02-19T18:06:58Z,I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if it is literally worse than what qualcomm offers. I don‚Äôt think it is a coincidence that the debut of their in house chip is happening on the cheapest model in their lineup.
2025-02-19T18:18:41Z,"Exactly, they needed to roll out a product to start to get ROI from the project, but they certainly are debuting it on the pro model knowing they'll get pushback from their most particular customers. No one's going to complain with their cheapest product."
2025-02-19T18:40:45Z,"Either it performs worse 

Or it makes such a difference to battery life that they want to downplay those benefits at the moment so as not to make the ‚Äònewer‚Äô phones look worse. 

Wait for the iPhone 17 event for them to talk it up at length. 

I‚Äôm sure this move to their own modems is a big part of the slim phone being practical"
2025-02-19T19:16:58Z,I think they want to see how it does before they go boasting about what it can do.
2025-02-19T17:12:42Z,"Because there isn't much to brag about in the modem business ... it's been monopolized for years, unless there are clear, user-experience-based metrics, no one really cares about modems, unlike CPU's where users can test them through benchmarks ..."
2025-02-19T18:06:40Z,Apple loves to brag about small updates that other devices have had form years though. No way they would miss that marketing opportunity unless they are unsure of how it will perform.
2025-02-20T02:18:27Z,"R1 chip performs quite well on the Vision Pro, but still only a few words in the introduction."
2025-02-19T18:08:25Z,"Okay, let's entertain this... give me 3 things you (as a marketing engineer or whatever) could say about a modem chip to a public audience without having to give a crash course about radio networks .. I'll wait"

2025-02-19T16:45:05Z,"Video playback is normally done on WiFi, not on 5G. So I doubt the modem is the reason for it.

&gt; Testing conducted by Apple in December 2024 and January 2025 using preproduction iPhone 16e units and software, subscribed to LTE and 5G carrier networks. Video playback consisted of a repeated 2-hour 23-minute HDR movie purchased from the iTunes Store, tested with stereo audio output. Video playback (streamed) consisted of a repeated 3-hour 1-minute HDR movie purchased from the iTunes Store, tested with stereo audio output. All settings were default except: Bluetooth was paired with headphones; Wi-Fi was associated with a network; the Wi-Fi feature Ask to Join Networks, Auto-Brightness, and True Tone were turned off.

From here: https://www.apple.com/iphone/battery.html

Also on the video of the launch, they mention it has a bigger battery. Which could easily explain the extra 4 hours of video playback.

But hey, imagine tech ""journalists"" bothering to actually check Apple's own website for information!"
2025-02-19T21:19:29Z,"Very good odds that Qualcomm modems crush the C1 in performance. A good step, but there‚Äôs a reason it launched on the entry level phone and not the flagship"
2025-02-19T23:12:23Z,Or it wasn‚Äôt ready for the flagships
2025-02-19T17:32:35Z,"For any prospective buyers I'd wait for thorough reviews to see how the modem performs. Ars Technica and Notebookcheck usually do pretty good reviews.

I had so many dropped calls on my XS with Intel modem. This was on a few different carriers too."
2025-02-19T22:09:12Z,how did you determine the modem was the cause of the dropped calls?
2025-02-19T23:58:01Z,There is no way for end user to tell. Dropped call could be due to modem / AP / RF conditions / carrier etc. Can only rely on comparison to performance of other devices
2025-02-19T22:36:49Z,This is the biggest thing.  But need to know how it does against the latest qualcomm one.  Once thats known ill get

2025-02-20T01:40:37Z,Very strange Apple only mentions this once on the product page. I'm sure we'll hear more about this in September when C1 (or maybe C2) comes to iPhone 17.

2025-02-19T17:10:56Z,"Now Apple basically has no critical hardware dependencies on any outside vendor (except chip manufacturing), which I believe increases their bargaining power and profits percentage."
2025-02-19T17:59:10Z,Display is a still a major one though?
2025-02-19T18:51:54Z,I would argue Displays are much more critical than a modem.
2025-02-19T23:01:00Z,I had the XS with the intel modem. Mother of god did that thing absolutely SUCK for reception and speed. I got rid of it ASAP almost exclusively for this reason. Just google iPhone XS modem if you don‚Äôt believe me lol‚Ä¶.I‚Äôd stay far far away from any non-Qualcomm modem.
2025-02-20T16:51:22Z,"I had an XS Max with the intel modem and it did really suck for reception and speed, like you mentioned.

2025-02-19T16:30:09Z,Thank you for saying something different and not just whining about the price or MagSafe like 90% of the other comments. Excited to see what this modem can do.
2025-02-19T16:09:58Z,How does this thing not have MagSafe?
2025-02-19T16:15:35Z,To sell the regular 16
2025-02-19T21:53:01Z,Just made MagSafe a premium feature again lol
2025-02-19T16:27:01Z,"I believe Apple has seen what android manufacturers are doing and adopted the same practice for their 16e phone

where instead of magnets in the phone, customers will have magnets in the cases. and since majority of people use cases with their phone, it makes little difference for the end user. And Apple saves a bit of money not including magsafe. 

As a no case person, I would be disappointed but this phone wasn‚Äôt designed for me (I tend to go with the Pro Max iPhone instead)"
2025-02-19T17:05:50Z,"It‚Äôs not just for case, it‚Äôs also for faster wireless charging. Important for many battery banks, including Apple‚Äôs own"
2025-02-19T17:36:53Z,God I wish Apple would refresh the Magsafe Battery
2025-02-19T18:09:34Z,They basically did! They just released it as an Anker battery pack that‚Äôs exclusive to Apple
2025-02-19T18:50:18Z,Which one is that? Anker has several models so it‚Äôs a little confusing.
2025-02-20T00:39:20Z,"It‚Äôs a 5000 mah slim MagSafe pack and honestly it‚Äôs crazy good for the size, the 16s have no real need for it unless u are going consistently 18+ hours without charging 

https://www.apple.com/shop/product/HRY02LL/A/anker-maggo-power-bank-5k-slim-blue

Cannot emphasize how slim they‚Äôve managed to make this even more than the slim one Anker sold previously"
2025-02-19T16:48:02Z,"So, can you buy a MagSafe case, and get it to charge the phone?"
2025-02-19T17:34:36Z,"You can always charge it, it still supports wireless charging. Just no magnets to stick on to the MagSafe charger. But with a MagSafe compatible case you‚Äôll get the magnet functionality too"
2025-02-19T16:18:06Z,I wager the answer is that MagSafe is not widely used by budget conscious consumers and it was a place to cut costs.
2025-02-19T16:21:28Z,"At $600, this isn't a phone for budget conscious consumers."
2025-02-19T16:22:29Z,Right? It's ‚Ç¨750 in the EU so basically $750 how is that a budget phone üíÄ
2025-02-19T16:26:02Z,How much is the 16?
2025-02-19T16:29:23Z,949‚Ç¨
2025-02-19T16:30:44Z,"Apple is not expecting anyone to pay full price for this. This is the corporate phone, mobile ordering device phone and $0 phone with carrier plan."
2025-02-19T17:29:20Z,"Yeah good point. Could totally see companies getting these in bulk. 

Does the ‚ÄúE‚Äù stand for Enterprise? ü§î lmao"
2025-02-19T17:30:36Z,There's no student discount for it either.
2025-02-20T00:42:19Z,"No iPhones have student discounts, but fun little fact if you decide to buy a older gen phone at the Apple Store (currently the 15/14) and claim to work at a big corporation like Google, Meta or easier to say work in the Federal Government, you can snag a $50-70 savings on most products and all accessories"
2025-02-19T16:31:20Z,"I politely disagree. It‚Äôs $200 cheaper than the 16, and that‚Äôs if you buy it outright, which is not a thing a ‚Äúbudget conscious‚Äù consumer is likely to do.

If you‚Äôve got an iPhone 12, it‚Äôs an even trade through your carrier. I suspect this will be the popular option.

If you‚Äôve got something older or don‚Äôt want to do that trade it, it‚Äôs going to come out to about $8-15/mo on a carrier payment plan, as long as you don‚Äôt leave for 24 months.

And finally, I suspect we‚Äôll see these become ‚Äúfree with new line‚Äù, which will be popular with families where kids are getting their first phones or young adults are getting off their parent‚Äôs accounts."
2025-02-19T16:08:47Z,"$499 or even $529 would have been a much better price point. As usual, it's just that little bit overpriced enough that it makes you second guess if you really need it at checkout."
2025-02-19T16:21:50Z,No worries. It will continue to be $599 for 3 years ;) The value proposition can only get worse with time.
2025-02-19T16:29:11Z,Realistically this will be the $0 phone with Carrier plan in about a year or so. The ‚Äúfull‚Äù price is there so that no one actually buys it in store.
2025-02-20T00:20:20Z,That‚Äôs just a US thing. We don‚Äôt buy phone from carriers anymore and won‚Äôt pay a hundred bucks per month for a phone number.
2025-02-19T17:02:12Z,"Maybe in US, would not say that for the rest of the world. Generally phones get devalued once a new generation is released."
2025-02-19T18:12:58Z,Are you considering hyperinflation? $599 in 3 years might be like $59.99 today.
2025-02-19T16:15:16Z,$499 would‚Äôve been the perfect price but Apple know what they‚Äôre doing.
2025-02-19T16:40:32Z,"Yeah, that‚Äôs the ‚Äúwell the normal 16 isn‚Äôt really *that* much more expensive‚Ä¶‚Äù price."
2025-02-19T19:13:41Z,"I was actually looking into upgrading from my 13PM to an SE so I can rely on a single phone through college in the fall. *that‚Äôs* the amount I was looking to pay after bumping the storage up, now it‚Äôs the ‚ÄúApple price ladder‚Äù where you can just get this, but this only costs a bit more, and some end up all the way to the top.

Apple and Google are making me just want to switch to a dumb phone to save money (besides still have an iPad and Mac..), why can‚Äôt there be an underdog os option like how Linux is?"
2025-02-19T19:19:45Z,"I just replaced the battery on my 13 Pro rather than trading it in for a new one, these pricing games are getting frustrating and there aren‚Äôt even significant updates to make it worth it unless you‚Äôre skipping several generations. At this point I‚Äôm probably just going to hold on to this phone until it‚Äôs no longer supported and then pay cash for a replacement."
2025-02-19T19:28:40Z,"Honestly if I wanted to not have guaranteed updates, I‚Äôd just get an Android phone. It‚Äôs why I switched because I‚Äôd have phones that were cool and affordable, but hardly ever saw an update.

The second hand market exists, the people that burn through money can buy it while us budget conscious people buy the best kept phones for the price, incentivizing them to take care of it for more money like some do now. Especially with newer phones having to comply with increasing repairability standards across the world.

Why give Apple money directly if they don‚Äôt want to price it well for most consumers?"
2025-02-19T16:34:22Z,Wish I knew what I was doing¬†
2025-02-19T16:43:30Z,I was expecting it to be $450 actually because it was supposed to be the SE.
2025-02-19T16:19:47Z,They couldn‚Äôt really do that since it is almost an iPhone 16 and they could have done a 64 gig $499 version which they would understandably have been panned for. Getting an iPhone 16 chip means that it is going to age exceedingly well and is more powerful than the iPhone 15 that they also still sell.
2025-02-19T16:22:49Z,Yeah that‚Äôs steep. The SE had so many carrier promos so I‚Äôm hoping the same happens with this one.
2025-02-19T16:12:13Z,"699 in Germany, I‚Äôm leaning on a hard NO‚Ä¶
Too much for just a ‚Äûwork‚Äú phone"
2025-02-19T19:11:35Z,719 in the netherlands.... insane prices.
2025-02-19T19:44:35Z,The full-fledged 16 can be found in mint condition for under ‚Ç¨700 here lol
2025-02-19T16:18:23Z,"900$ in Canada? 

Yeah that‚Äôs gonna be a no from me boss."
2025-02-19T16:10:37Z,"The European prices are INSANE, who is this phone for, once you can put out 700 euros for this you should able to afford the regular 16."
2025-02-19T16:21:34Z,"This is specifically for the American market. The budget carriers (Metro, Cricket, Total) will have this available for $199 within a couple of months, likely $99 for Black Friday."
2025-02-19T16:25:56Z,"This is crap, most Americans buy with a contract and will buy the regular 16 since the price difference is marginal. 

What Apple needed was a 499 phone for Europe, where people buy their phones money upfront, that also didn‚Äôt look 10 years old, especially since the pandemic-induced super cycle is 5 years old at this point and a lot of people are looking for a new phone."
2025-02-19T17:58:58Z,"&gt; This is crap, most Americans buy with a contract and will buy the regular 16 since the price difference is marginal.

It‚Äôs hard to find data for this, but it‚Äôs just not true anymore compared to how it used to be.

[This](https://www.pcmag.com/news/forget-contracts-most-americans-now-buy-their-phones-outright) is the best that I could find, but it‚Äôs not the best source."
2025-02-19T16:16:15Z,They are defeating the whole point of what the SE was. A cheap entry into iOS ecosystem
2025-02-19T16:38:19Z,That‚Äôs why this one is named 16E and not SE. üòâ
2025-02-19T16:42:35Z,"The E is for ‚ÄúEconomical‚Äù

And we think you‚Äôre gonna love it!"
2025-02-19T16:51:11Z,E for Expensive
2025-02-19T16:23:21Z,"Wait, is this the new SE? Are we not getting the real SE now?"
2025-02-19T16:24:19Z,"From what I understand, this is replacing the SE"
2025-02-19T16:26:57Z,"Yah, the last SE was discontinued. The 14 and 14 Plus was also discontinued"
2025-02-19T16:14:34Z,"I don‚Äôt know, the price to value is not there IMO. It sits too awkwardly in this space between ‚Äújust buy a regular 16‚Äù and it not being budget enough like the SE.

Of course, I‚Äôm also not Apple with their billions spent on market research so I won‚Äôt be so cocky as to say this will flop lol."
2025-02-19T16:34:16Z,The poor value is to discourage sales on this. Apple WANTS full price customers to buy the 16. The carrier customers that want to pay $199 or $99 will get this.
2025-02-19T21:11:31Z,"Jokes on them, I didn't like the 16 series and this was the last thing I was waiting for before buying a pixel."
2025-02-19T17:34:19Z,"Lmao that is basically their entire stratergy atp..., when checking out you'll be like ehh this just a 100-200$ less than the 16, and that too with less than half of the features, at that point you'll feel like just cashing in the money and just get a 16..., they always make you climb the ladder man, always."
2025-02-19T18:07:39Z,Don't buy this crap. Better off to find an iPhone 15 Pro from somewhere at a reasonable price.
2025-02-19T16:29:03Z,729‚Ç¨ in the Italian market. What a shit show.
2025-02-19T16:08:00Z,"Starting 729‚Ç¨ in Italy, they‚Äôre gonna sell like 3 units"
2025-02-19T16:31:02Z,"And it doesn't even have MagSafe for that price lmao. Not sure who would buy this over a brand new iPhone 15, that even has better cameras too.  

On Amazon, a brand new iPhone 15 is 743‚Ç¨, whereas this new 16e is 729‚Ç¨. No brainer."
2025-02-19T17:00:46Z,"But this has Apple Intelligence!

  
/s"
2025-02-19T16:22:54Z,"&gt;The Action button on iPhone 16e also unlocks a new visual intelligence experience that builds on Apple Intelligence to help users learn about objects and places.¬†

Why can't my iPhone 15 Pro do this again? When the 16 was announced, I was told it was because I didn't have a camera button."
2025-02-19T16:58:18Z,"I have a shortcut for google lens which functions the same.

2025-02-19T16:07:37Z,No MagSafe???
2025-02-19T16:13:40Z,I just checked and no MagSafe.
2025-02-19T16:07:28Z,$599? No thank you
2025-02-19T16:11:31Z,[deleted]
2025-02-19T16:26:16Z,$900 CAD is fucking hilarious. What a huge miss. Is this just a demo model for the C1 modem? Who would buy this?
2025-02-19T16:20:17Z,Once you experience MagSafe. You don't go back.
2025-02-19T16:48:06Z,60hz?
2025-02-19T16:09:43Z,Damn. There‚Äôs no magsafe. Just Qi wireless charging. Pay 600 USD and end up with this?
2025-02-19T16:11:09Z,What the fuck is wrong with them? That‚Äôs become a staple of the Apple ecosystem.
2025-02-19T16:29:43Z,Price ladder
2025-02-19T16:15:03Z,"Qi version 1, from 2017. The Qi2 standard came out in 2023 and is very magsafe in its implementation."
2025-02-19T22:39:38Z,Should‚Äôve just stuck the new chip in a 13 mini
2025-02-19T16:25:03Z,This should be 499‚Ç¨ not 699‚Ç¨ lol
2025-02-19T16:50:41Z,749‚Ç¨ here...
2025-02-19T16:13:04Z,"I‚Äôm not offended at the price like everyone else seems to be, but no MagSafe is absolutely head scratching."
2025-02-19T16:31:45Z,"I wonder if the magnets are actually decently expensive or there wasn't room for them. Funny though, this and the AirPods 4 without MagSafe charging."
2025-02-19T16:40:24Z,The QI charging magnets exist on 5$ cases for android phones that come without magnets so I cannot imagine that the bill of material is very high.
2025-02-19T17:33:42Z,"According to the MagSafe wiki they use rare-earth magnets which are strong but considerably more expensive for instant alignment. Also all new MagSafe phones support 25w Qi charging which probably needs a beefier coil. The standard also includes NFC connection for accessories so I can see how its omission can save a good chunk of money but the phone is expensive still. since apple can push the 15 with two cameras, Dynamic Island, MagSafe etc for only 100 dollars more just with no AI."
2025-02-19T16:28:14Z,Who is this for?
2025-02-19T17:02:26Z,‚Ç¨719? And this is supposed to be a budget model? They're out of their mind in Cupertino. No one is going to buy phone.
2025-02-19T18:36:18Z,$899 in Canada. DOA.
2025-02-19T16:20:07Z,"Just a bad deal, why would they even release this."
2025-02-19T16:57:38Z,How can you remove a core from the A18 chip and still call it the same chip?
2025-02-19T19:31:02Z,"great cuestion, technically this is not the same A18 but a new A18E"
2025-02-19T19:14:23Z,That's how chips work.  Same thing with Mseries chips.
2025-02-19T16:06:37Z,iPhone 4 reincarnated

2025-02-19T16:32:48Z,Is this a joke? $599 STARTING? With no MagSafe?! Apple has truly lost the plot...
2025-02-19T16:50:22Z,"I genuinly feel like a lot of people would not mind spending $200 extra for iPhone 16, this phone is just a very awkward position and mainly used to just get people with the ""ah if i spend $200 more i get a better phone"" type of mindset."
2025-02-19T16:18:09Z,"Overpriced, especially in Europe."
2025-02-19T16:36:07Z,This is Apple‚Äôs way of pushing people to buy the regular iphone 16.
2025-02-20T00:33:33Z,"Everyone talking about how it's the C1 chip giving it longer battery life, but the battery test is done on WiFi.

If you go to Apple's battery information, https://www.apple.com/iphone/battery.html, it says the tests were done on WiFi:

&gt; Testing conducted by Apple in December 2024 and January 2025 using preproduction iPhone 16e units and software, subscribed to LTE and 5G carrier networks. Video playback consisted of a repeated 2-hour 23-minute HDR movie purchased from the iTunes Store, tested with stereo audio output. Video playback (streamed) consisted of a repeated 3-hour 1-minute HDR movie purchased from the iTunes Store, tested with stereo audio output. All settings were default except: Bluetooth was paired with headphones; Wi-Fi was associated with a network; the Wi-Fi feature Ask to Join Networks, Auto-Brightness, and True Tone were turned off.

and

&gt; Testing conducted by Apple in December 2024 and January 2025 using preproduction iPhone 16e units and software, subscribed to LTE and 5G carrier networks. The playlist consisted of 358 unique audio tracks purchased from the iTunes Store (256-Kbps AAC encoding), tested with stereo audio output. All settings were default except: Bluetooth was paired with headphones; Wi-Fi was associated with a network; the Wi-Fi feature Ask to Join Networks and Auto-Brightness were turned off.

Apple also says on the announcement video that [it has a larger battery](https://youtu.be/mFuyX1XgJFg?t=230).

I'm sure the chip is efficient if they say so. But I don't think the 4 extra hours on video playing, while on WiFi, are explained by the cellular modem.

To me it's either the battery difference, or the screen (which isn't the same one, as this one doesn't get as bright, nor as dimm as the one on the 16) having a lower brightness default value so it gives it an edge there."
2025-02-20T09:58:26Z,I dont get how every article misses the fact that they straight up said they put a bigger battery in
2025-02-20T10:04:38Z,"Someone replied with a decent point. Apple tends to make these vague comparisons. They never said what they are comparing it with, just ""larger"". Could be compared to the SE or 11 which are the two mentioned before. Or compared to if they didn't change the internals which would be random capacity we also don't know.

So it could be because of that."
2025-02-20T19:32:45Z,But wasn't wifi handled by the Qualcomm modem before?
2025-02-20T20:23:36Z,"No Broadcom did the combo chip (bt/wifi), which Apple also is taking over.

Also the Apple 5G doesn't support mmWave, which also cuts down power consumption (at least by leaving out the extra RFFE needed for that)"
2025-02-20T09:09:00Z,[deleted]
2025-02-20T09:59:53Z,"Yes, it's possible it a typical Apple sort of misleading comparison with older iPhones. Guess we'll know as soon as we discover the capacity of the battery.

If it's bigger, that explains it. If it's similar, then might be a lower brightness default setting on the screen.

We'll know soon enough."
2025-02-20T07:11:23Z,I'm really excited. My mom promised me one if I got 95% in my high-school final exams and I ended up scoring a 97% so yay I'm getting one this summer.

The fact that it has the same display, same CPU core count, and only 1 less GPU suggests the new custom modem chip is extremely efficient.¬†

This is so awesome!"

2025-02-20T20:19:04Z,the newer a18 chip is on 3nm node vs 5nm so it should more efficient even if the modem and everything else is exactly the same.

2025-02-20T07:36:19Z,"I don‚Äôt know, they tried to make Titanium on the pro phones sound revolutionary. A new modem is in my opinion more exciting than that, so I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if they tried to hype it up."
2025-02-20T07:51:52Z,"I mean, fancy metals have been selling shit for literal millennia.

On the other hand, I don‚Äôt think anyone has *ever* been trully excited about a modem."

2025-02-20T16:08:32Z,Why not? Arguably a better more efficient modem is more exciting than a crazy fast M chip I can‚Äôt even tax during every day use.
2025-02-20T07:14:37Z,Isn‚Äôt the battery larger since they removed the MagSafe connector?
2025-02-20T03:22:04Z,"I think in a roundabout way they are advertising it. I'm assuming the C1 is a downgrade by most speed benchmarks - but it's only a downgrade on paper. The reality is that for losing some performance as a modem, they're gaining quite a bit of battery life, which they're advertising for this phone. So they're not advertising the C1, but they are advertising its advantages."
2025-02-19T23:55:25Z,"I wonder how much the C1 chip, with its impressive efficiency, contributed to the price hike. I heard we would benefit from a cost reduction since Apple switched from Qualcomm to their own chip, but in reality, it comes with a $170 higher price tag."
2025-02-20T00:02:57Z,"I haven‚Äôt kept up as much with the ‚Äúe‚Äù phones, but isn‚Äôt this the closest one has come to parity with the base iPhone?

It‚Äôs got the latest chip, OLED, has the minimum specs for apple intelligence, actually looks and feels like a modern phone.

Really, if you pose it as ‚Äúthis is $200 less than a base iPhone and only lacks a handful of features‚Äù, it seems pretty reasonable to me. The list of features it lacks by the way is relatively small. Worse camera, no Dynamic Island, no shutter button. No mm wave 5G. No magsafe. But that‚Äôs about it."
2025-02-20T02:54:11Z,"The features that you mentioned are lacking from the 16 are features I could 100% do without on my 16. The 16e is $250CAD cheaper, I'd easily give up all those for that money, and the 16e also has about 15% better battery life which I was not expecting, figured they would cut corners since this isn't for power users. 



But my thinking was the same between the 16 Pro and 16 - didn't need the Pro features so I went with 16. But now I wouldn't need the 16 features and could go with the 16e. Apple's notorious for perfectly pricing things so that you jump up the price ladder, but this cycle is working in the opposite direction imo"
2025-02-20T02:37:40Z,"Nah, it‚Äôs pretty on par with the previous gen SE‚Äôs specs wise. The 1st gen launched with the A9, the latest chip at the time, and the 2nd gen launched with the A13, same thing. 3rd gen also had the A15 in 2022. The OLED display is fair, but it‚Äôs also last if not two generations old specs wise (800 nits peak brightness, same as the 11 Pro).  I guess if you see Apple Intelligence as a selling point, that‚Äôs fair, but so far, it‚Äôs been whelming on my 15 Pro Max."
2025-02-20T00:24:38Z,"It's only extra $50, compared to the 128GB SE, adjusted for inflation.

Someone might be getting fleeced here, but I doubt it's the customer."
2025-02-20T14:05:41Z,"My only difference maker for me in the UK is the phone is ¬£599; you can get a 16 on Amazon for ¬£699 an extra ¬£100‚Ä¶ I think you might as well at that point get the 16 for that price.

But I agree I think the price for Apple products is fair - it‚Äôs Apple , budget isn‚Äôt really in their vocabulary.

It‚Äôs always going to be higher in price than other brand alternatives. There‚Äôs a price premium to Apple products and always has been"
2025-02-20T21:27:33Z,But that‚Äôs still an extra ¬£100‚Ä¶ which many won‚Äôt even need those features.
2025-02-20T06:14:32Z,"FINALLY, someone‚Äôs who‚Äôs compared apples to apples instead of apples to oranges

So many people are fixated on the price and the the last SE models were cheaper, however you got less RAM and storage in those base model phones"
2025-02-20T07:50:01Z,"You should be comparing the lowest price of each, not equivalent storage and RAN sizes. 

Technology moves forwards, sizes increase. Those shouldn‚Äôt come with a price jump each time. It‚Äôs just not the correct way to compare them. 

The entry price of the cheapest model has increased, that‚Äôs what matters."
2025-02-20T07:53:29Z,"Right, but as the original commenter above me stated the different isn‚Äôt much when you account for inflation, or.. are we just going to ignore that too in an attempt to try and make a point by misunderstanding as to why 3-5 years later the price has increased"
2025-02-20T07:46:00Z,"The complaints have been utterly asinine. It literally seems to be ‚Äútoo expensive, I‚Äôll buy the even more expensive one, instead.‚Äù Or ‚Äúthey‚Äôve added stuff to make the price higher, should‚Äôve kept it exactly the same it was before.‚Äù

You can‚Äôt make this up."
2025-02-20T07:56:35Z,"It‚Äôs like people are doing the mental gymnastics in there head and done exactly what Apple want them to do, not buy a phone made from older or binned parts and purchasing the higher tier phone

If Apple removed even more features like Apple Intelligence thus reducing the RAM, keeping the storage at 64GB instead of increasing it they‚Äôd be like ‚Äòthese specs in this day and age is appalling!"
2025-02-20T09:12:49Z,It‚Äôs crazy how defensive y‚Äôall are over this.
2025-02-20T09:21:19Z,"Believe it or not, people who knew stuff actually used to frequent this place."
2025-02-20T13:56:29Z,I get annoyed by constant complaining.
2025-02-19T23:59:37Z,"There‚Äôs no amount of improvement to a budget phone to get me to pay more than $500. If that puts a lid on what they can offer (Apple Intelligence? Who tf cares?) then fine, but I want a budget phone, not a worse version of the regular line of phones for slightly cheaper."
2025-02-20T00:35:56Z,"&gt; I want a budget phone, not a worse version of the regular line of phones for slightly cheaper.

Interesting wording.

Anyway, what should this ""budget"" phone of yours look like, then? What should it have this one doesn't?"
2025-02-20T00:38:54Z,"It should be cheaper. Whatever features have to be cut to keep it cheap, do it.

It made sense that the iPhone SE was cheaper since it explicitly used parts from older lines, so it saves excess parts that go unneeded as phones age. As far as I‚Äôm concerned they should have stuck with the iPhone 8 body, home button and everything. 

The people buying those phones in 2025 don‚Äôt care about facial recognition or MagSafe or Dynamic Islands. They care about the phone being cheap."
2025-02-20T00:48:10Z,So just keep selling the SE?
2025-02-20T00:49:07Z,"Update the chips inside, make it more powerful, but don‚Äôt worry about all the bells and whistles. Use old leftover parts from iPhone 13 or 14, you don‚Äôt need to update the whole thing."
2025-02-20T00:50:59Z,"If the only point is for it to be cheap, then it doesn't matter how current the hardware is.

And also, we have so many fucking options now, if this one isn't enough, there are literal thousands of phones that might suit you better."
2025-02-20T00:54:29Z,"Not with Apple OS. Some people like the Apple Ecosystem. I use a Mac and iPad for work, having an iPhone that can use the same apps, airdrop things around as needed, and access my iCloud natively is important to me, but I‚Äôm not buying the highest end iPhone. I just want a budget option that‚Äôs not a used phone when my current SE reaches the end of its life."
2025-02-20T01:02:42Z,"&gt; Some people like the Apple Ecosystem

And you have the option to pay for it, or not. Up to you, nobody owes you an iPhone, mate."
2025-02-20T01:05:21Z,There is a market for it. This isn‚Äôt complaining because apple won‚Äôt cater to a very specific niche that a handful of people care about. This is a large market of people who aren‚Äôt being served.
2025-02-20T04:46:52Z,"It eventually will but right now they have to make up for all the money spent on R&amp;D for it plus the acquisition of Intel modem team. They‚Äôve been working on this for like 6-7 years, so that‚Äôs a lot of money that needs to be made back."
2025-02-20T08:34:01Z,I am guessing its because the screen maxes out at 1200 nits instead of 2000.
2025-02-19T23:50:26Z,"Rumors are that the battery size will be 3,279mAh compared to 3561 mAh on the iPhone 16. The phone is pretty meh overall, but I hope the new modem is good and provides substantial battery life improvements for the iPhone 17 series."
2025-02-20T15:58:46Z,Same. I just want the 17PM to last two entire days with usage. That would be amazing!
2025-02-20T10:34:09Z,"God damn can people please stop using mAh? Use Watt hours (Wh). It‚Äôs literally the only way you can compare any two batteries without knowing the voltage, etc¬†"
2025-02-21T19:56:44Z,"You know, sometimes I see power banks being advertised in kmAh (kilo miliamp hours) and it pisses me off so much"
2025-02-21T19:58:05Z,LMFAO WHAT? That‚Äôs ridiculous. Manufacturers are so inept.¬†
2025-02-21T03:08:40Z,"Fr. Watt hours is so much of a nicer unit too, don‚Äôt know why so many people still report this in mAh"
2025-02-21T08:52:22Z,Aren't all lion/lipo batteries in cell phones the same voltage wise ? 3.7V-4.2V range
2025-02-21T14:15:00Z,Aren‚Äôt all phone batteries the same voltage?
2025-02-20T02:50:41Z,Cuz of all the missing features
2025-02-20T07:37:37Z,[deleted]
2025-02-20T19:39:14Z,Really ?
2025-02-20T18:46:17Z,"Took out the MagSafe magnet for a bigger battery, good trade.  You just need a MagSafe case to fix it.   It can still charge magnetically at 7.5w"
2025-02-21T14:28:01Z,See babe. I told you that six inches is long.¬†
2025-02-20T00:52:46Z,"6.1 inch‚Ä¶sounds familiar

2025-02-21T07:20:10Z,"That's like saying i have biggest dick for all 5.2 feet people

makes for a good headline, but doesn't mean much."
2025-02-19T18:42:55Z,"It‚Äôs interesting how these websites work. A million post about each individual spec about the iPhone. Like it‚Äôs literally bullet point information but for clicks it‚Äôs separated into 91 separate, 1 paragraph articles."
2025-02-19T18:45:39Z,It‚Äôs really tiring
2025-02-19T18:45:21Z,Because people will click and engage in comments to collectively complain. The system works.
2025-02-20T19:40:33Z,"People like to make fun about Redditors not opening articles and such, but to be fair, I‚Äôd say this is at least one of the reasons."
2025-02-19T20:08:19Z,"&gt; A million post about each individual spec about the iPhone. Like it‚Äôs literally bullet point information but for clicks it‚Äôs separated into 91 separate, 1 paragraph articles.

SEO. They are maximizing the amount of people that will visit their websites from search engines. If you search for ""iPhone 64GB"" right now, can you guess the top 3 links?

For me they were: 

- Apple: Buy iPhone SE 64GB (which leads to the site's landing page for iPhones)
- Amazon: iPhone 11GB link
- MacRumors

And before someone asks ""who is searching for that?"", think about your non-tech family members/friends. They are the ones consuming those basic articles."
2025-02-19T20:28:16Z,"I totally get what OP means. It‚Äôs crazy how these sites split specs into tiny posts just to hit more keyword searches. I‚Äôve seen this work in my own content play, even though it can feel a bit overdone sometimes. I tried Hootsuite and Buffer in the past for engaging audiences, but Pulse for Reddit is what I ended up using because being active on Reddit brings in real traffic and improves SEO. Interweaving genuine discussion with smart keyword targeting can really make a difference."
2025-02-19T23:30:10Z,"Split content really makes a difference for organic reach. I found that breaking info into shorter, focused posts not only attracts casual readers but also helps those specific keyword searches. I started with Buffer and Hootsuite for my social media, but XBeast is what I ended up using because it automatically handles my Twitter posts and saves tons of time. Mixing genuine discussion with smart keyword targeting has boosted my traffic. Keeping content clear and easily searchable continues to be a solid approach for staying visible."
2025-02-20T02:02:14Z,I‚Äôm very busy and want to know which colors it comes in. Again I‚Äôm very busy. Can someone please write an article that just focuses on the colors? I‚Äôm very busy!!
2025-02-19T19:08:48Z,Let‚Äôs not forget the mouth breathing redditors like OP who feel compelled to repost them here¬†
2025-02-19T18:53:05Z,It‚Äôs sad a lot of the major Apple fansites turned into tabloid sensationalism. I hope one day it returns to normal
2025-02-20T05:08:01Z,"It's enshittification, the core feature is that it doesn't get better."
2025-02-20T05:30:01Z,I used to love following MacRumors but over the last year they have been overloading my feeds with these low effort posts and I ended up unsubscribing all together. I figure anything important will be ok Reddit anyways. But I‚Äôm also considering filtering them out of my Reddit feeds too because it‚Äôs too much.
2025-02-19T21:07:54Z,"And all of them get posted on reddit, and all of them draw discussion. Which is the point. People primarily engage news through social media, rather than browsing the site directly"
2025-02-20T03:37:58Z,Welcome to Reddit!
2025-02-20T10:19:15Z,SEO stuff
2025-02-20T15:43:50Z,What‚Äôs worse is these fucking bots that keep posting them here
2025-02-22T02:51:37Z,Business model of clicks instead of paying subscribers
2025-02-19T18:43:56Z,"Given the jump in price from $429  for a base SE3 to $599 for a base 16e, the increase in storage was the least they could do."
2025-02-19T19:55:23Z,They could‚Äôve also added at least a 90hz screen like even $200 android phones have.
2025-02-19T20:19:35Z,"To be fair, this was not expected anyway since the 16 also still has a 60hz display"
2025-02-19T21:04:47Z,"The 16 also should have gotten it.

They still have USB 2 ffs, sometimes it feels like Apple just does it on purpose."
2025-02-19T23:17:06Z,"That‚Äôs because it probably is‚Ä¶ The base model iPhones are so confusing because all in all they still are solid phones, but the things they then proceed to limit to the pro models are baffling. 

Like, I get trinkling down pro features to the base models every year, that is a perfectly fine strategy, but how come a specific camera button makes it to the base model and not something as basic as a higher refresh rate screen, which nearly every other phone on the market does have? Why hasn‚Äôt that made it to the base model? And the sad thing is that I think we all know the answer."
2025-02-20T00:39:10Z,"See, I don't mind too much _those_ features being ""exclusive"" because yeah, they gotta differentiate.

But when it's about putting USB 2, a 20 year old protocol on an $800 phone is crazy. Even USB 3 is like a decade old already. Like putting Wifi 6 on a $600 phone when we've had 6e for like half a decade already.

Feels very off place on a ""premium-ish"" (price wise) device."
2025-02-20T19:05:32Z,"Sucker here, the two reasons I went for the 15pm over the plus were the bezels (and the overall size that bought it down to) and AOD. 

Unfortunately apple know their market"
2025-02-20T09:32:29Z,"Hell, the 16 pro might as well have usb 2, since that‚Äôs the freaking cable they give you with it."
2025-02-20T15:38:47Z,"If you don't have a usb 3 cable around the house that you can use for data transfer, you didn't need the extra speed in the first place"
2025-02-20T22:32:52Z,I have dozens of cables. I have no idea what speed any of them are.
2025-02-20T22:35:52Z,Kinda seems like a you problem
2025-02-19T20:23:44Z,But this is a new phone‚Ä¶
2025-02-19T23:13:19Z,"That is true, but it is also the lower version of the 16. It and the 16 and pretty much every iPhone from the past, what, four years? Should‚Äôve had anything over a 60hz display, I definitely agree, but I‚Äôm not surprised that the 16e doesn‚Äôt have it when its more expensive variant didn‚Äôt have it in the first place"
2025-02-20T05:31:26Z,But a 90hz display wouldn‚Äôt be *ProMotion*. Maybe‚Ä¶.*PlusMotion*?
2025-02-19T23:01:13Z,"Nice, Apple. Now do iCloud."
2025-02-20T12:06:06Z,This would be really great to see. 5gb is so small when the entire phone lineup can record 4k video.
2025-02-20T15:27:20Z,See that actually would cost them so much more money.
2025-02-19T18:45:03Z,"Yes, because IA requires a lot of space"
2025-02-20T10:54:40Z,I personally think Apple did this out of kindness of their heart
2025-02-20T14:56:39Z,"Tim Cook looking at the dial controlling storage manufacturing: ""Yeah, you know what, just this once. It's been a good day."""
2025-02-20T09:56:08Z,"Much needed update, given the inflation I'm actually surprised the price didn't go crazy, was expecting around $699"
2025-02-20T12:13:53Z,The average consumer according to apple:
2025-02-22T17:58:49Z,Finally! 64GB in 2025 was a joke. Now if only they‚Äôd stop charging insane prices for storage upgrades‚Ä¶
2025-02-20T03:06:55Z,I want a 2TB IPhone pro max
2025-02-20T13:36:25Z,Do you actually need it for your use case or nah? I can‚Äôt imagine using up a whole TB. I got a 512GB just because all my current music and apps take up half of 256GB and wanted to not worry about space over the next several years. If you like slapping on a ton of downloaded movies and shit that makes sense.
2025-02-20T16:20:58Z,I have an IPhone 15 Pro Max and I‚Äôm at around 950gb storage used right now so yeah I will eventually need a 2tb storage option.
2025-02-20T18:26:47Z,That‚Äôs fucking wild. For real? Is it too personal of a question to ask what is taking up that much space?
2025-02-20T19:32:33Z,I have a 2tb iPad Pro but I like that my phone just fits right in my pocket and is generally more convenient
2025-02-20T19:31:40Z,I have like 350gb of manga. I also save YouTube videos as mp4s that I like to watch at a later time. A lot of mp3s and I take a lot of videos and photography. I don‚Äôt use iCloud because I don‚Äôt want to constantly have to pay a subscription and I want all my data to be on hand at any time. Also a few games.
2025-02-20T19:36:32Z,"Have you read most of that manga or is a lot of backlog because my anime backlog grows faster than I complete a series? I recently thought about going back to MP3‚Äôs because I miss manually controlling my collection but I‚Äôd have to find and download roughly 6,000 songs and that‚Äôs a lot of work."
2025-02-20T20:06:48Z,I‚Äôm prob about 30-40% read through. Sometimes i like to go back and reread certain series though. Yeah I got tired of paying for Apple Music. It took me awhile but I got all the songs I wanted lol.
2025-02-21T05:23:54Z,There was a time when using 128gb was hard to do
2025-02-21T01:47:43Z,iphones in 2030: ‚Äúall storage spaces start at 1TB so Apple intelligence can work smoothly‚Äù
2025-02-22T03:45:57Z,USB 2 still with us though...
2025-02-20T23:19:54Z,256 minimum should be standard
2025-02-19T19:14:32Z,"Lol, welcome to 2016."
2025-02-19T22:35:13Z,"Honestly this is how it should be for the forseeable future.

128GB is MORE than enough IMO. You can hold plenty of photos, apps, videos on that. Even quite a few games.

i still reguarly get the 256GB varients and its plenty for me. never had a need to go higher."
2025-02-19T22:56:04Z,"I‚Äôve had the same backup since 2008 and I‚Äôm still at about 50gb.

Thanks for coming to my TED talk."
2025-02-19T22:58:30Z,"I got downvoted for stating the obvious lol.

People don't realize who this phone is even for.

It's for boomers. Most of them have low capacity phones as it is. 128GB is plenty for them."
2025-02-19T23:02:44Z,The *e* is for *elderly*.
2025-02-19T22:47:41Z,Credit where it‚Äôs due. That‚Äôs very well done by Apple.
2025-02-19T18:54:04Z,Cuz 64GB will go to AI bullshit
2025-02-20T03:08:02Z,5.67gb on my 16PM
2025-02-20T05:45:34Z,Yeah makes sense to be able to store more than 1500 photos on your phone lol
2025-02-19T17:32:13Z,A new iPhone 15 here is just 90‚Ç¨¬†more than this 16e. Is the 15 a better choice at this point?
2025-02-19T18:04:43Z,"Mostly it seems. For that extra price you get

‚Ä¢ A slightly higher quality screen with much more brightness
 
‚Ä¢ MagSafe and Qi2 and Qi1 wireless charging (16e has only Qi1 charging speeds)

‚Ä¢ A better camera with an ultrawide lens, better image stabilization and focus, Cinematic/Action camera modes

‚Ä¢ Wideband chip

The only couple of legs the 16e seems to have over a 15 is its new battery optimization (+30% more battery life) and its ability to use Apple Intelligence. Mind you that you‚Äôd likely need to use higher charge rate cables due to no MagSafe/etc. 

The action button versus the mute switch is mostly preference I‚Äôd say, but is a nice button to have if you really care about using it for what it offers."
2025-02-19T18:08:42Z,"Uhm so the only things that I would like to have and missing in the 16E would be the Cinematic camera and better stabilization. All the other stuff I don't care too much honestly.

But it does feel like they have excluded too much stuff to excuse a price of 700‚Ç¨."
2025-02-19T21:21:38Z,And in 4 years they‚Äôll discontinue the ‚Äúcheap‚Äù option and claim no one bought it.
2025-02-19T17:53:58Z,The 15 will be cheaper than it if you buy from a third party.
2025-02-20T07:03:21Z,Yes. Apple intelligence won't be good enough for a few years to really take advantage of it. This phone is released to have more beta testers for AI
2025-02-19T16:54:21Z,This also means no or limited capability with many of the vehicle digital key (aka phone as a key) systems.
2025-02-19T17:46:57Z,"Sorry, but does anyone who can afford a car with that feature really want the cheapest iPhone?"
2025-02-19T20:29:36Z,"Maybe not many. 

But it also limits the Find My function on accessories such as AirTags and AirPods Pro"
2025-02-20T04:23:47Z,"That's especially baffling, that you won't be able to find an airtag with the ""Arrow"" pointing you where you should walk to head towards the airtag. It'll just say you're about 10 meters away or whatever, without any clue what direction to head in."
2025-02-20T10:11:54Z,"It‚Äôs hard to realize how good this feature is until you have to find something without it. 

My AirTags and AirPods all have it obviously but my Apple TV remote doesn‚Äôt. I‚Äôm walking around the living room like a fool moving my phone left right up down, putting it under the couch, touching drawers, standing in random spots, taking 3 steps and standing again, just to find the remote. 

Meanwhile my AirTag might be in my truck outside and it‚Äôll walk me straight to it once it connects. 

Crazy handy"
2025-02-20T08:16:42Z,Non-Apple find my tags don‚Äôt have this feature either. But I do agree it‚Äôs a bit silly given I expect the 16e to be a perfect kids phone. And Apple literally just showcased how the UWB allows you to find your friends in a crowd. Would have thought it makes sense to make this a core Apple capability.
2025-02-20T15:55:32Z,AirPods have this feature too so this phone is incapable of using that function to find your AirPods case
2025-02-19T18:03:01Z,Many Hyundai and Kia models have it nowadays and UWB has existed for a long time.
2025-02-19T18:10:46Z,"These cars will be on the used market very soon, so more people will be buying them. Not defending anything, just stating my opinion. I think 16E is not a good value for money."
2025-02-19T18:35:42Z,"Of course not  I can afford a new iPhone, but I‚Äôm still rocking a base model 2012 ford escape."
2025-02-19T19:47:46Z,"Yeah you make a point. but here‚Äôs a better point, no UWB means no precision finding for airtags &amp; airpods"
2025-02-19T18:04:48Z,Doesn‚Äôt that work with NFC?
2025-02-19T18:14:59Z,Depends on which vehicle manufacturer.
2025-02-20T12:16:06Z,My iPhone 12 works as a digital key
2025-02-19T17:03:23Z,MagSafe too
2025-02-19T17:44:27Z,It doesn‚Äôt have MagSafe? Wow¬†
2025-02-19T20:26:48Z,but it does have Qi wireless charging. I wonder if a MagSafe case would work.
2025-02-19T21:19:12Z,Yea maybe but you definitely lose fast charging.
2025-02-19T22:08:10Z,Also it‚Äôs the slow Qi speeds and not Qi2 which is weird as a company that helped improve Qi2. It‚Äôs pretty weird.
2025-02-19T22:46:44Z,This looks more like a cashgrab than a ‚Äúnext‚Äù phone to me‚Ä¶
2025-02-19T23:34:39Z,"It‚Äôs literally not a ‚Äúnext‚Äù phone. They even used the same number as the current phone. I don‚Äôt feel like that‚Äôs shady, it‚Äôs very clear this is just a slightly worse 16 for a lower price."
2025-02-19T22:50:39Z,Spigen has a MagSafe case for the 16e so presumably yes it would work
2025-02-19T22:00:09Z,so it doesn't stick?
2025-02-19T22:51:12Z,No you‚Äôll need a help of a MagSafe case for that.
2025-02-19T19:56:00Z,Also Wi-fi 6.
2025-02-19T17:06:25Z,719 Euro? ü•≤
2025-02-19T17:18:23Z,yeah it‚Äòs better to buy a used 15 Pro for that price
2025-02-19T18:35:30Z,"If you don't care about Apple intelligence (which I think applies to most users atm) even a new iPhone 15 is about the same price. If you're happy going refurbished, 15 pro is a no brainer.

This phone basically exists for people who want to walk into an Apple store and buy ""an iPhone"" or who want the cheapest contract that comes with ""and iPhone"", if you're willing to shop around at all, it's a terrible deal."
2025-02-19T19:41:33Z,"yep, though the 15 Pro does have Apple Intelligence. 

but i‚Äòll probably keep using my 12 for a while."
2025-02-19T21:02:09Z,A 16 is also almost 800‚Ç¨. So you either go 16 or 2nd hand 15 pro
2025-02-19T18:25:14Z,"I believe the 16e was launched to satisfy the SE users with a lower priced iPhone, but priced to make you just spend the extra on the 16."
2025-02-19T22:45:25Z,"I just wish it was still small. My wife and ¬†father have a mini. This baby isn‚Äôt offer much in that regard.

Not surprising with the market, but a bummer to see."
2025-02-20T01:00:50Z,"Hard to pack shit into a small form factor, and you can't really headline 19 hours of battery life when doing so"
2025-02-20T01:01:39Z,See if they‚Äôd done a mini‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd of bought it. Could have been the same price just smaller I‚Äôd pick the smaller
2025-02-19T16:53:37Z,Oh it's missing out on a lot.
2025-02-19T17:07:34Z,"Yeah MagSafe and sensor-shift camera stabilisation are also a pretty big omissions from the iPhone 12/13 days.

Edit: FWIW, here's what 'standard' iPhones up to 14 did better than 16e:

* **iPhone 5**: DC-HSDPA connectivity
* **iPhone 11**: Ultra Wideband, 0.5x zoom
* **iPhone 12**: MagSafe (Qi2) magnets and wireless charging at 15W, 5G mmWave
* **iPhone 13**: Sensor-shift optical image stabilization, Focus control for portrait mode, Cinematic mode for videos (1080p)
* **iPhone 14**: Cinematic mode for videos (4K), ""Action mode"" for videos"
2025-02-19T19:24:46Z,"DC-HSDPA is an interesting omission, wonder if it has to do with Qualcomm patents"
2025-02-20T00:57:53Z,"No, it's because it's not used anymore.

3G has been shut down by every major carrier and 5G has been adopted nationwide for most Americans.

It's such a weird little detail to add in that the iPhone 6E doesn't support advanced 3G tech, it's just hating on what Apple took out rather than actual things of substance like MagSafe

Also this uses Apple's own 5G chip rather than the Snapdragon X75 meaning the ability to improve efficiency knowing exactly what devices will use the chip so they can take out essentially 3G support"
2025-02-19T20:24:24Z,Most definitely
2025-02-19T17:35:28Z,"It also doesn‚Äôt have Wi‚ÄëFi 7, and its A18 is binned (4 GPU cores vs 5 on the iPhone 16)"
2025-02-19T17:58:46Z,WTF. I thought only Pro models since 13 had sensor shift stabillization.
2025-02-19T21:57:04Z,"For someone who doesn't take a lot of photos, there's actually not a lot they're missing out on though."
2025-02-19T19:39:39Z,Huh? Wtf is that comparison lol?
2025-02-20T04:07:48Z,Now ask a 100 people if they knew what those features are and if they wanted them for their next iPhone
2025-02-19T23:33:24Z,"I don‚Äôt see the big deal - the lack of MagSafe is only really relevant if you don‚Äôt use a case. It still has wireless charging, but without the magnetic ring, and more slowly. Get a case that supports MagSafe, it‚Äôll include the ring, and you‚Äôll be good to go."
2025-02-19T17:07:12Z,This is a terrible iPhone with e everything they gutted
2025-02-19T17:20:36Z,They even gutted the price! WTH!
2025-02-19T21:37:17Z,"I wish, this phone is way too damn expensive for what it is."
2025-02-19T17:18:45Z,iphone 16 ‚Äúehhh‚Äù
2025-02-20T19:15:03Z,This.
2025-02-19T16:44:05Z,damn so it can‚Äôt even use airtag precision finding functionality?
2025-02-19T16:50:01Z,"Correct, you can't use an iPhone 16e for precision-finding your AirTag, according to Apple's official specs."
2025-02-19T16:54:12Z,"That is a profoundly stupid omission, wow. They‚Äôre gonna make their other accessories seem worse to save a couple bucks, big brain."
2025-02-19T20:30:00Z,"You know some parents are going to be yelling at their kids about how they can't ""precision find"" their car keys in the morning and why did the kids tell them to upgrade from their iPhone 12 to a 16e."
2025-02-19T21:24:06Z,That impacts their ecosystem. Lots of strange choices with this phone. I bet they‚Äôre thinking people want Apple Intelligence but it sucks.
2025-02-19T17:34:17Z,does it mean u cant precision find airpods and apple watch too? Cuz that's just dumb.
2025-02-19T18:02:13Z,"No, you can't. You also can't unlock your vehicle (if you have a CarKey w/ UWB capable car) or Homekit lock with UWB support.

You can't also find friends with the Find My app."
2025-02-19T22:58:37Z,Ah well that‚Äôs the absolute dealbreaker for me. There‚Äôs a lot of features I‚Äôd be willing to sacrifice but that‚Äôs not one of them. This is the perfect phone for meemaw
2025-02-19T17:46:58Z,Im scared about the possible price of the 17 line if this is 709‚Ç¨ in Spain
2025-02-19T18:08:10Z,This phone is such a bad deal!
2025-02-19T18:08:19Z,"Bad deal for a lot of money, no way I‚Äôm paying ‚Ç¨729 for this"
2025-02-19T17:49:50Z,"If this phone were missing this, MagSafe and was still $499 it would be ‚Äúpassable‚Äù. But for $600??? No way. 

Might as well have brought back the unapologetic plastic to drive down the cost if they really needed to. This is a waste."
2025-02-20T16:59:49Z,98% of people who buy this phone will NOT give a fuck about any of this missing shit. They are just gonna see that it‚Äôs $200 cheaper than a regular 16 and buy the fuck out of it. You guys in here complaining about all this garbage that only enthusiasts and high level users care about and guess what‚Ä¶.youre gonna buy a pro anyways
2025-02-19T19:28:44Z,"Too expensive we went from a $579 SE to a &amp;
$899 16e

So it seems we have no budget phone anymore."
2025-02-20T01:20:49Z,"They seemingly cut a lot of features and still priced it at $600. Ooh boy. At that point, buy a used 15 or 14."
2025-02-19T16:53:00Z,It also only has WiFi 6
2025-02-19T17:10:15Z,"I would put money down that like 95% of people who might buy this phone don't even understand that wifi has generations, much less the specific differences between the generations themselves"
2025-02-19T22:25:23Z,I‚Äôd bet it‚Äôs closer to 98%.
2025-02-19T17:02:37Z,"Thats fine for a budget phone

  
 Missing uwb for airtags is strange"
2025-02-19T17:15:09Z,Not sure it should be considered a budget phone at $599.
2025-02-19T17:26:53Z,"It‚Äôs just the bottom rung of the ladder, increase the storage and throw in a case and suddenly the iPhone 16 looks more appealing."
2025-02-19T17:15:50Z,This is not a budget phone
2025-02-19T16:57:28Z,Tbh with how slow the rollout of WiFi 6/6e has been I‚Äôm not even sure if this is going to matter to 99% of people.
2025-02-19T17:23:58Z,Where are you seeing the WiFi specs for it? I can‚Äôt find them anywhere. No articles mention WiFi specs.
2025-02-19T17:25:58Z,"The ‚ÄúCompare Models‚Äù section: https://www.apple.com/iphone/compare/?modelList=iphone-16e,iphone-15"
2025-02-19T22:40:52Z,"4x4 Wifi 6 is honestly good enough. No other apple devices support WIFI 7, and 6E routers are such a slow rollout since it joined much later than Wifi 6."
2025-02-19T17:42:50Z,"So so much for a good AirTags experience. Honestly these Cookian feature pulls are just absolutely absurd in 2025.

Like what's next, 17e with no speaker. Or just 5G no wifi? Like at point do you stop Benihana'ing devices and just make good stuff.

Why do they even need a entry level phone when they keep selling old units? How about those can be the ""entry"" level? Then we could just go back to having iPhone and iPhone Pro and a more consistent experience."
2025-02-19T18:45:49Z,"I laid the specs for 16e next to 16, and it makes a clear, compelling case for 16 if you can afford it."
2025-02-19T20:27:27Z,It makes a compelling case even for the 15
2025-02-19T16:56:23Z,they‚Äôre trolling at this point. this product is literally a middle finger to all consumers
2025-02-19T17:20:35Z,This is what passes for a budget iPhone since Apple has also discontinurd the SE.
2025-02-19T19:24:25Z,Just buy a refurbished iphone 13 pro. It's literally better in most ways and costs way less
2025-02-20T01:58:36Z,"This is an interesting comparison but you‚Äôve got a point. With the 13 Pro you get Promotion, LiDAR, ultra wide band chip and MagSafe. 

You‚Äôll lose out on the better base camera and Usb-C but that‚Äôs it as far as I can see."
2025-02-20T11:40:10Z,"You also lose out on the A18, battery life, and AI (if that matters to you). This 16e might be the most bizarre phone Apple has released. It does many things right, but is missing some odd things."
2025-02-19T16:48:27Z,"I‚Äôm looking forward to seeing the intel, now apple chip reviews."
2025-02-19T17:28:31Z,It all comes down to 300 dollars to get a regular 16. JFC just buy a 15 pro at this point. With carriers heavily discounting phones who TF is going to buy this?
2025-02-19T18:26:10Z,That's a very good point. You can get a 15 pro for like $500 which is a better phone in every way.
2025-02-20T00:24:45Z,Where?
2025-02-19T18:28:51Z,Who the fuck is this for? Idiots?
2025-02-19T19:02:57Z,So new crippled iphone costs more than used 15 pro? They have lost their plot.
2025-02-19T22:18:37Z,Using my 12 for as long as it can last at this point
2025-02-20T01:47:48Z,Would have been hilarious if it had the Lightning Port
2025-02-20T02:59:31Z,Missing UWB and MagSafe makes this dead on arrival for me.
2025-02-20T04:03:46Z,"Wait? Does it not even have the first gen uwb chip?! Can this thing not work with precision finding airtags?!

Not that it matters much to most of the folks I‚Äôm helping as clients/friends but damn that‚Äôs a stupid feature to leave out completely if they did."
2025-02-19T16:32:59Z,This is actually quite surprising to me. MagSafe should be a standard feature. Why would Apple not want to maximize profits with MagSafe accessories across their lineup?
2025-02-19T16:43:01Z,Especially when the lightning MFi gravy train is on the way out.
2025-02-19T16:44:26Z,Qi2 accessories don‚Äôt get licensed.
2025-02-19T19:13:08Z,"But MagSafe does, I believe, separately from Qi2.¬†"
2025-02-19T19:42:33Z,They are basically the same thing. You don‚Äôt have to get a MagSafe license if you target QI2. Unless you really want to use the term for marketing.
2025-02-19T20:11:57Z,"There‚Äôs already Qi2 compatible products and devices without magnets. See the latest Samsung flagships. They tout Qi2 but don‚Äôt have magnets.

I thought it was part of the standard but seemingly not."
2025-02-19T20:59:59Z,[deleted]
2025-02-19T21:03:53Z,"Whatever it is, it‚Äôs hella confusing. Qi2 was supposed to fix this issue, but now we have the branding used in confusing ways. 

With MagSafe we have a similar problem but just for charging speeds. MagSafe compatible vs MagSafe certified. The latter won‚Äôt give you the best speeds. But the product will still be fully functional. 

with qi2 now, some variations of branding having magnets and some not is a very poor experience since the magnetic attachment is the key perk of Qi2 for most of these accessories."
2025-02-19T21:02:36Z,Those Samsungs are Qi2 *ready*.  The idea is that you put a case with magnets on the device and then it allows full Qi2 functionality.
2025-02-19T21:08:16Z,"IMO that the magnets are the key perk of qi2. Otherwise the previous Qi standard already supported wireless charging. Not being able to rely on the Qi2 branding and having to be aware of the details kinda defeats the whole purpose. 

There‚Äôs MagSafe compatible and MagSafe certified but at least both those experiences still utilize magnets. Just the charging speed is impacted, which might not even be noticeable to the end user. I was excited to see Qi2 take off but the current implementations suck. At least the option is there for those of us that are willing to dive into the details of the specs. Just wish we didn‚Äôt have to and could just rely on the term Qi2."
2025-02-20T10:12:30Z,"That‚Äôs wild. I never looked into it but I would‚Äôve assumed, without a doubt, thag qi2 standard included the magnet or whatever is in our phones that makes MagSafe work. What was even the point of the new standard if it doesn‚Äôt do what I thought it was supposed to, aside from not needing the MFA certification to fast charge an iPhone"
2025-02-19T20:11:32Z,"Are the Magsafe accessory attachment animations specific to magsafe or do they also occur on Qi 2?

Also curious if the communication that enabled the apple magsafe battery pack to display its battery level is considered part of the Magsafe spec separate from Qi 2."
2025-02-19T22:27:15Z,The animations are because Apple devices have an NFC tag that tells the phone what they are. It‚Äôs not part of any other spec.
2025-02-19T17:09:34Z,"The phone still supports wireless charging, which means theoretically you can still use MagSafe case to use MagSafe charging accessories. It‚Äôs just not built into the phone."
2025-02-19T18:49:13Z,"But at just 7.5W, though."
2025-02-20T05:15:47Z,Ohhhhhh interesting. So I could use a MagSafe case then attach a MagSafe battery pack &amp; it would charge?
2025-02-20T18:49:13Z,"Yes, but only at 7.5 watt."
2025-02-19T16:43:07Z,Because they‚Äôre going to maximize profits by selling a more expensive phone
2025-02-19T16:44:59Z,Qi2 accessories aren‚Äôt licensed products.
2025-02-19T19:35:45Z,MagSafe isn't licensed?
2025-02-19T20:07:03Z,I think people with peacemakers would disagree. I love magsafe but some people cannot use newer iPhones because of the interference which can be caused by strong magnets.
2025-02-20T09:22:04Z,"This is not a real problem‚Ä¶
NIH testing shows that there‚Äôs only a potential problem at a distance of 1 cm
https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9303345/

Apple recommends not to get the charger closer than 30 cm (12in) when charging
https://support.apple.com/en-us/109025

This is more or less the same as the recommendation for a cell phone in general
https://www.fda.gov/radiation-emitting-products/cell-phones/potential-cell-phone-interference-pacemakers-and-other-medical-devices

If you have a pacemaker, I recommend doing your own research‚Ä¶ but the post about MagSafe above is a little more than uninformed fear mongering"
2025-02-19T17:37:31Z,"To push people who care into their $800 mainline phone instead of the $600 el cheapo one.

There's not that many features cut out of this phone vs the 16, they had to segment the market somehow."
2025-02-19T23:03:15Z,How are they gonna hold up the phones on the current Apple Store stands without magnetic attachment
2025-02-19T16:43:21Z,"To cut production costs and improve yields, most likely."
2025-02-19T16:44:44Z,A group of magnets that they‚Äôve been implementing in their phones for five years can‚Äôt be that hard to produce.
2025-02-19T16:48:08Z,"But if it cuts a dollar from production costs, that saves them $100,000,000 in production costs if Apple produces 100,000,000 of these phones. You have to understand that Apple makes **a lot** of phones, and their shareholders have ridiculously high EPS expectations."
2025-02-19T17:18:21Z,"Apple has only sold 20 million or so SEs per year. This will be replaced far sooner than it ever cracks 100 million.¬†

https://9to5mac.com/2022/03/28/iphone-se-demand-low/

The increased price will also likely reduce volume for this model."
2025-02-19T18:06:57Z,Most people here haven't worked a day in product development and it shows.
2025-02-20T13:48:15Z,"Most people don't understand that you can criticise a decision, as a consumer without knowing every part of the production line, and it shows"
2025-02-20T02:40:04Z,It‚Äôs almost as if the belief that Apple derives a significant percentage of their $391 billion annual revenue from MFi licensing is wrong.
2025-02-19T16:23:35Z,"From the article: Just like the now-discontinued iPhone SE, the iPhone 16e does not have MagSafe connectivity.

This means accessories such as ‚ÄåMagSafe‚Äå cases, chargers, battery packs, and wallets will not work with the device. None of the silicone cases for the iPhone 16e are ‚ÄåMagSafe‚Äå cases. Despite this omission, the ‚ÄåiPhone 16e‚Äå continues to feature standard Qi wireless charging up to 7.5W.

This makes the ‚ÄåiPhone 16e‚Äå the first iPhone with a ""modern"" design to miss out on ‚ÄåMagSafe‚Äå. ‚ÄåMagSafe‚Äå was introduced with the ‚ÄåiPhone‚Äå 12 lineup in 2020 as a new accessory ecosystem."
2025-02-19T20:15:40Z,"I bet this is to ensure iPhone ‚Äúenthusiasts‚Äù that spend more money on Apple don‚Äôt switch to this cheaper device. This device is meant for folks that wouldn‚Äôt otherwise get an iPhone. Apple doesn‚Äôt want anyone that‚Äôs willing to pay for a 16 or up to get this $600 phone instead. MagSafe debuted with the iPhone 12 so long time Apple customers, outside of SE users, may already have MagSafe accessories that will make switching to the 16E unappealing. 

Or they‚Äôll have to buy a MagSafe compatible case. Which Apple may get a cut of the sale for."
2025-02-19T20:36:52Z,This is exactly it. There‚Äôs assuredly full analysis on these models to ensure they don‚Äôt cannibalize their existing offerings.
2025-02-19T16:50:16Z,"It says it does support wireless charging. So maybe a magsafe case will still provide the magnetic centering for the wireless charger.

All the rest yeah. It's really a device to plug a small hole in the market, probably children phone. Not something they expect to reinforce the apple ecosystem, in this case, magsafe. The workhorse of iphone is the iPhone16."
2025-02-19T17:20:15Z,"It's the iPhone 16 without Magsafe.
OLED, thin bezels, A18, 8 GB.
How is it a ""children phone""?"
2025-02-19T16:26:00Z,"I knew it had to be gimped somehow for the 15 &amp; 16 to still make sense, but I did not expect *that*."
2025-02-19T23:04:11Z,I mean I doubt that the single camera will be very good for low light stuff
2025-02-19T17:27:31Z,Was so ready to ditch my 12 mini for this but no MagSafe is a deal breaker. Now I‚Äôll for sure run my mini into the ground
2025-02-20T05:40:56Z,"Imagine if every few releases they threw us a new mini. 

We get it. Its not profitable every release but maybe every 5 releases it makes sense. 

Here is to a iPhone 17 mini."
2025-02-19T22:24:43Z,You will be able to still use magsafe cases or even stick the magaafe ring on it.....
2025-02-20T00:01:55Z,I occasionally use my phone without a case and I‚Äôd prefer not to add a MagSafe ring to it. Why should I have to come up with a solution to a problem that didn‚Äôt exist before
2025-02-19T17:51:49Z,"This is a very deliberate choice. 

A calculated omission, to drive people to the other phones 

Imagine how their lineup is going to appear in stores now. 

This phone won‚Äôt be sat on a MagSafe type stand the way all the newer flagship phones are. 

It will sit off to the side on one of those old school charging docks. 

When a customer goes to pick it up it will feel older immediately than the phones that magically/magnetically clip on and off."
2025-02-19T19:37:34Z,iphone 16e has a USB-C port so it won't fit the old lightning docks lolllll
2025-02-20T02:16:06Z,not very carbon neutral to be designing a whole new dock just for this one model...
2025-02-19T20:25:38Z,What docks? Apple is picky with how it displays its phones and there no such thing as usb c dock from Apple.
2025-02-19T21:16:19Z,"they use proprietary MagSafe stands in the stores... they will have some sort of USB-C Dock built into their tables before long too

I sorta doubt the 16e will just be laying on the tables connected via usb-c

apple will still want it upright on some kind of stand"
2025-02-19T18:34:46Z,I think this is the right take. I hope so otherwise this fall is gonna be a weird one for iPhone releases
2025-02-19T16:44:08Z,"Man, I was hoping to move from a 13pro to this. But the no MagSafe is indeed a deal breaker. Otherwise I‚Äôd be happy."
2025-02-19T19:27:14Z,Just wondering why you want to switch from the 13 pro? It honestly seems better in every way to this.
2025-02-19T23:43:11Z,"New device itch, but you‚Äôre right. There‚Äôs really no reason to move to it, save for maybe USB-C.  X was my last phone prior to this and I‚Äôd argue the 13pro doesn‚Äôt even feel like a significant jump from that.

I have been trying to stick with this phone for a long as possible. The battery is probably the only thing that I have issues with now even after replacing it, but it‚Äôs really not that bad. Otherwise the phone is very capable and I should really run it until it dies."
2025-02-19T17:45:24Z,"And this is exactly the point. 

They don‚Äôt want this phone appearing like a perfect upgrade at a better price for anyone upgrading from a 12-14

I figured the camera would be enough"
2025-02-19T17:58:02Z,Same here. Too many limitations and price is too high. Would just rather get the iPhone 16 instead.
2025-02-19T18:39:43Z,"Same! I invested a lot in MagSafe! I have the official portable battery pack; MagSafe charger stand for the phone and watch; a MagSafe docking station‚Ä¶ 

I‚Äôll just buy a used iPhone 15 or something."
2025-02-19T16:47:07Z,"Thought id want this phone for my grandparents so they wouldn‚Äôt have to struggle with plugging in their current SEs anymore. They aren‚Äôt usually good at aligning them to the wireless charger I gave them. With no MagSafe on this, I‚Äôm bigly disappointed."
2025-02-19T16:55:34Z,"Qi2 cases are easy to find, but you can stick a metal ring on any phone. They come in multi-packs."
2025-02-19T16:29:33Z,"Probably the worst iPhone Apple has ever released. For $100 more you can get the 15. For $70 more you can get a refurbished 14 Pro. For $200 more just get the 16 or 15 Pro refurbished. This is $900 in Canada! What a joke and it has a worse camera, no magsafe, no dynamic island, and no .5 camera in 2025 that's disgusting. OH but it has Apple Intelligence which barely anyone even uses and the A18 oh man. So bad"
2025-02-19T17:03:27Z,"This is the Apple way 

They use price anchoring to push people towards higher tier devices 

Embarrassing no MagSafe but knowing Apple this thing is gonna still sell really well"
2025-02-19T17:05:45Z,"&gt;For $100 more

It‚Äôs $130 more here in the US. Also, the iPhone 15 specs were before the massive AI spec bumps which makes it an awful buy today. 25% less RAM, 2 year difference of chipset (A16 vs A18), and likely less long-term software support as a result of these differences."
2025-02-19T20:17:40Z,Also has 60hz screen and 1 less GPU core
2025-02-19T16:31:15Z,"yes but those are more money.... so for the price conscious, this is the best option."
2025-02-19T16:44:25Z,"No, you‚Äôre better off getting an older/used 15 model for the same price."
2025-02-19T16:53:13Z,"‚ÄúUsed‚Äú will always be a factor that you can‚Äôt use in the math of a new device. 

Why get a 2024 car when you can get a used 2020 car?"
2025-02-19T19:09:08Z,"I think it‚Äôs ridiculous but also ingenious that they managed to find that one noticeable-but-actually-not-that-essential feature to cut.

Or they‚Äôre just not brave enough to gut the charging port this time around."
2025-02-19T19:03:01Z,"What a joke, considering all that it‚Äôs missing from this phone, 599 is a tall ask."
2025-02-19T17:00:59Z,"Sucky, but I'll just find a case with magnets in it, that's what I do currently with my 11 that doesn't have MagSafe."
2025-02-20T13:17:34Z,"I think many of us, myself included, are thinking about this wrong. This is not an update to the SE. This is a new line of iPhone that hasn‚Äôt existed before. I think we should stop trying to compare it to the SE and lament the extinction of the cheap iPhone."
2025-02-19T16:55:14Z,"It will still support qi charging, so you could get a magnetic charging case to add back magsafe compatibility. A lot of Android phones do this now"
2025-02-19T16:29:24Z,"What a waste of time &amp; money, apple had a perfect chance to win a ton of consumers making a ‚Äúbudget‚Äù model (successor to the SE) but of course they pulled an Apple

I‚Äôd rather they simplify the lineup &amp; kill the 15 as well &amp; make the 16e exist"
2025-02-19T16:32:50Z,"They will most likely kill the 15 in September, when the 17 family launches."
2025-02-19T16:34:30Z,"They will, but then they‚Äôd still sell 16s. The point is by the time the 17 launches, they‚Äôll still have 16s available just like right now where the 15s are still available in the 16 lifecycle"
2025-02-19T17:05:40Z,"$1200 in NZ vs $850 for the SE3 yesterday. 

$350 more and no mage safe ‚Ä¶ hell no."
2025-02-19T17:20:01Z,So they made it an open standard and shared it with the Qi foundation to make Qi2 and then removed it from their latest phone? lol
2025-02-19T18:12:18Z,Well there will be 3rd party magsafe cases soon
2025-02-19T19:27:14Z,You can go on AliExpress and get MagSafe rings for like $1.
2025-02-19T18:47:28Z,"Odd that Apple is not selling MagSafe cases for the 16E.

The 3rd party market will fill this gap really quickly, but this seems like it would have been a pretty easy sell internally."
2025-02-19T17:42:20Z,My car charger uses magnets to hold my phone while I navigate with gps (and obviously charge)‚Äî I‚Äôm gutted this was looking to be the perfect upgrade for me
2025-02-19T21:10:48Z,Just get a MagSafe case or ring.
2025-02-19T17:04:44Z,I never used it so it doesn't bother me.
2025-02-19T23:24:09Z,"I don't really care about the charging speed, but I do care about the magnets. I have a 13 Mini with a failing battery and, despite still wanting the mini form factor, I was pretty set to upgrade to the new SE, now 16e, to get more battery life &amp; support for Apple's AI (not for today, but for future updates). I can get by with the other ""SE"" downgrades, but I use MagSafe a lot outside of just charging (wallet, car mount, desk stand, TV &amp; monitor mounts for continuity camera, tripod, other mounts I have installed around my house).

The 16e looks to be using a 14 form factor, so the magnets should fit, and the cost would have to be negligible, especially when they have increased the price from the SE anyway. It's just a very annoying omission."
2025-02-20T04:25:20Z,Yea it‚Äôs a deal breaker.
2025-02-19T20:48:33Z,"iPhone SE 3: I'm the worst ever value iPhone

iPhone 16E: Hold my charger (I can't bc no Magsafe)."
2025-02-19T16:57:05Z,"I‚Äôm still gonna buy it, as the 256gb is STILL $200 cheaper than the 16 256gb. I don‚Äôt use the ‚ÄúMagSafe‚Äù at all on my current iPhone, so it‚Äôs not a huge loss for me being that the 16e won‚Äôt have it. I‚Äôm more hyped that the camera is 48mp and it will be able to do ALL the Apple Intelligence features and it has the Action button"
2025-02-19T17:09:55Z,magsafe is one of those features where if you dont use it much or at all (or have the right accessories) you dont know what you‚Äôre missing and are fine with it. im in the other camp. cant live without it
2025-02-19T17:15:48Z,"Yeah, I understand completely what you mean. For me personally being somebody that has tried it, but just hasn‚Äôt found the real day to day use for it. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs not a huge loss for me like I don‚Äôt even do the MagSafe charging, I charge my phone with the wire plug straight into my phone lol"
2025-02-19T17:19:24Z,"your phone charges faster, so at least there is that üôÇ"
2025-02-19T17:28:49Z,"For me personally I just don‚Äôt see paying another $40-$50 for the MagSafe charger/cord alone when my current $20 dollar apple 20w brick does just fine lol. Like I even bought the iPhone 16 from Apple 2wks ago just for the new AI features I had it for a week then returned it when the rumors came in with the specs for the new iPhone se4/16e leaked. I had the 16 256gb model totaling to $982 after taxes. Now I can get the 16e have the same Apple Intelligence features, same 6.1 60hz screen, and have the same 48mp camera for $200 less."
2025-02-19T20:20:17Z,I never thought I would use MagSafe until I got gifted a car mount that goes on my AC grill. I love it and I love how simple it is compared to past car mounts
2025-02-19T18:09:26Z,"Others are saying it can still wirelessly charge, right? So, would it still have the magnets to align with a wireless charger like the Belkin MagSafe Charger 3-in-1 but not use the tracking features of the Apple wallet? Or is it no wireless charging period? Are their cases that have a thin USB-C cable with an attachment built in to enable wireless charging?"
2025-02-19T23:07:45Z,"Rumor is the magnets in the MagSafe was causing issues with the antennas, which would make sense."
2025-02-19T23:32:54Z,"Cheaper model phone has less features, more at 11"
2025-02-20T07:32:44Z,"This is honestly a deal breaker for me. I have an iPhone 16 Pro as my main phone and use my old iPhone 15 non-pro for work. I was hoping to replace it eventually with a 16E but lack of MagSafe, considering I just bought an Anker 3 in 1 cube for $150, is a total deal breaker."
2025-02-20T10:16:25Z,"No MagSafe in any Apple device nowadays is a fumble. Personally, I keep a port plug in my phone + I‚Äôll never be able to justify buying an iPad until when/if they add MagSafe to them. Not to mention the fact that they‚Äôve now rereleased the Magic Mouse with usb-c and STILL skipped wireless charging of any kind (which would fix the questionable port placement)."
2025-02-20T15:06:21Z,What a fuckin‚Äô fail. C1 is truly the only highlight of this device.
2025-02-21T03:15:30Z,Or downside. We'll see how it is later.
2025-02-20T17:59:15Z,"Unless Apple is planning on phasing out MagSafe and this is the first step‚Ä¶ (I highly doubt it) This is the biggest own goal by Apple I‚Äôve seen on a hardware launch in a while. 

It‚Äôs clear that they‚Äôre using this to try to differentiate their lineup, probably because they needed to put the latest hardware in this phone for Apple intelligence support so the difference between the 16e and 16 is pretty thin. But segmenting their accessory ecosystem seems like such a stupid call. People who buy the 16e will feel like they have been left out of the picture in a big way when they look to buy accessories for their phones, and it‚Äôs kind of contrary to Apples ‚Äúnew member of the family‚Äù marketing pitch. 

The 16 still looks different, has Dynamic Island, has better and more colour variety, and the ultra wide camera. That should be enough differentiation that doesn‚Äôt result in new customers feeling like they are owners of the ‚Äúother, lesser‚Äù phone. Especially because the 16e isn‚Äôt even that much cheaper on top of all this."
2025-02-19T20:53:23Z,Real test of price absorption will be the new MBA prices.
2025-02-20T02:55:02Z,Yep. 999 has to stay
2025-02-19T17:15:01Z,Apple preparing to raise the prices 30% in a few months and add 4gb more ram
2025-02-19T17:38:01Z,"Apple preparing to raise the prices 30% in a few months.

FTFY"
2025-02-19T17:45:19Z,Bro get your head out of your ass... there's no way we are getting 4GB of RAM üôÉ
2025-02-19T18:39:37Z,They just added 8GB to every base model Mac last year without increasing prices.
2025-02-19T18:54:12Z,"Exactly, thank you for this sensible comment.¬†"
2025-02-20T10:32:16Z,I don‚Äôt think that would have happened if LLMs didn‚Äôt boom two years ago.
2025-02-19T20:57:00Z,"Add 4gb ram? Fellas we have a dreamer here, haha."
2025-02-19T23:24:49Z,"I was looking at a new mini when I saw that 32gb of RAM would cost me $299 more dollars.

WAT"
2025-02-20T03:57:56Z,Yeah any upgrade makes waiting for new Mac Studio no brainer
2025-02-19T17:41:11Z,Your average Macbook purchaser isn't going to care about an extra 4GB of ram; i'm sure their crack marketing team knows that.
2025-02-19T20:01:15Z,Any source to dig deeper? Macs with 30% price increase is crazy.
2025-02-21T02:09:41Z,Can't wait for the marketing spin. I hate to love it.
2025-02-20T03:31:09Z,"And if the tariff goes away, Apple will raise prices again just for the hell of it."
2025-02-19T19:35:21Z,"The minimum should be 32 GB at this point with how cheap ram is anyways, and given that on Macs, the RAM is actually a bit less performant because they use the same shared memory for CPU and GPU. 

On PCs graphics cards have their own VRAM on the GDDR spec for maximum bandwidth and regular ram with DDR for latency, optimizing the memory for each of their respective tasks.

Macs use essentially phone memory, which is decent at both tasks but master of none."
2025-02-19T20:42:22Z,"You don't understand how Apple became the richest company in the world, do you? They know you'll pay $380 for 16GB of extra ram otherwise they would just make it standard."
2025-02-19T17:22:06Z,"What a patriot company , that‚Äôs why they probably raise $100 in the new iPhone 16e"
2025-02-19T17:47:42Z,And yet still makes the rest of the world cover us pricing
2025-02-21T00:13:56Z,Price for the same storage spec stayed the same. They just eliminated the smallest storage option.
2025-02-20T03:55:25Z,$200
2025-02-20T13:25:54Z,Nah they definitely wanted to release that 64gb model but couldn't. 64 would've been 499.
2025-02-19T18:37:01Z,"They did raise iPhone 16e by $170 (the last SE was $429, the new 16e is $599)."
2025-02-19T18:55:39Z,"Uh, respectfully, Pull out the calculator before writing your comments lmfao.

$429 -&gt; $599 is $170, not $259"
2025-02-19T19:00:48Z,"I know, I did use calculator BUT entered the wrong number to come to that number. It's addressed as I was pointed out."
2025-02-19T23:10:27Z,The 16e is basically the 16 with a worse camera. The previous SE wasn‚Äôt even close to the current flagship they were selling
2025-02-20T03:28:57Z,Is the phone 16e made in China? Shifted lot of production to India.
2025-02-19T22:54:34Z,"You get more base storage. So closer to what you would pay for that amount of storage in the first place. Not a $100 increase, more like $50"
2025-02-19T18:18:09Z,I bit the bullet and bought a 14‚Äù MacBook Pro a couple weeks ago. It‚Äôs a beautiful machine
2025-02-19T19:31:06Z,Bought my M4pro MBP about two weeks ago. Glad I did.
2025-02-20T02:28:01Z,What color you get?
2025-02-20T02:32:33Z,Got the space black
2025-02-20T01:23:36Z,"Got a MBA 16gb in Nov and I love it. I thought I‚Äôd regret the fanless machine but it does everything I need and can‚Äôt complain.

We use 14‚Äù pros for work and they are phenomenal. Even that thing can go through semi-heavy workloads fanless."
2025-02-20T01:27:59Z,"It‚Äôs such a huge change from my previous MacBook Pro, a mid-2012 13‚Äù. Not only was it a non-Retina display (with something like a BBBBx800 pixels), that thing would get hotter than lava if I used it on battery. Even just browsing the web. If I were editing videos, even SD content, the fan would spin up like crazy. I couldn‚Äôt even use it as a laptop until I got one of those lap pads with built in fans. Which did help, but drained the battery."
2025-02-20T02:36:38Z,"Similar here, got an M3 Pro from Best Buy for $1090."
2025-02-19T22:37:51Z,Same. Big Update from my 2013 pro from college
2025-02-21T00:22:09Z,I just bought M4 Pro Mac mini last week. Can‚Äôt wait to get it. This is my first Mac since my 2009 Mac Pro.
2025-02-19T21:09:44Z,Got my MP Pro a year ago. Whew.
2025-02-23T23:06:29Z,"My MBP M1 pro is still a beast.

I bought it mostly for the form factor, better fit for me than the MBA."
2025-02-19T23:03:48Z,How much manufacturing is still in China? I got an M4 Pro mini that was made in Vietnam.
2025-02-20T08:12:32Z,"A lot but Apple has been diversifying certain products particularly so they have solutions for the US and India (the 16e will probably have a bunch assembled in India) etc that can dodge most tariffs. The processors are made in Taiwan for all though.

Depends on the product line though. 

It is always the way, people think tariffs bring manufacturing into your country but they don‚Äôt unless every cheaper option was eliminated first. And you feel tariffs cumulatively while the target countries are free to trade among themselves."
2025-02-19T17:34:31Z,"Let's be honest, apple has always worked with huge profit margins compared to everyone else"
2025-02-19T21:32:28Z,This is probably because they already have enough stock in the US which is not affected.  Once that all dwindles down prices will go up. Or with new models coming out the prices will climb.
2025-02-19T18:14:56Z,"Ah, this thread is exactly what I was hoping it'd be: a bunch of ""nope, don't care, still hate ya"". Apple has truly reached that zone where they could donate a million to a bevy of programs today and the comment section would be riddled with ""they're worth a trillion - it's a drop in the bucket!"" and not ""damn, happy these programs will be able to benefit from it"""
2025-02-19T19:00:24Z,"People hated Apple when it was 30 days from bankruptcy. People hated Apple when it was the most valuable company in the world.¬†

2025-02-19T19:02:45Z,It‚Äôs getting annoying as hell
2025-02-23T18:05:01Z,More concerning are Tim Cook's (and other big tech CEO's as well) efforts to become best pals with the Trump dude. At any cost.
2025-02-19T18:31:46Z,"Indeed. You can‚Äôt convince me it‚Äôs not personal at this point. They‚Äôre just a tech company, but people sometimes act like they‚Äôre Umbrella or some shit lol.¬†"
2025-02-19T18:33:34Z,"And compared to other tech companies like Meta or X, Apple feels like a saint."
2025-02-20T23:55:36Z,"They‚Äôre a giant corporation and you‚Äôre acting like they‚Äôre out here absorbing costs to be nice. They don‚Äôt care about customer wellbeing .

They‚Äôre absorbing the costs because they‚Äôre one of the largest companies in the world and they can. Competitors are not able to absorb those costs as easily and will need to pass them onto the consumer, which will drive more users to buying MacBooks/increasing market share so that they can sell you other products now that you‚Äôre in the ecosystem. It‚Äôs a long-term strategic play and it‚Äôs naive to think otherwise."
2025-02-21T15:40:03Z,"&gt; Competitors are not able to absorb those costs as easily and will need to pass them onto the consumer

In any business there is a choice, those other companies choose not to absorb the cost and pass it on to customers. Regardless consumption is on a downward trend and if we enter recession it will fall off a cliff. So if Apple retains some sales but margins squeeze it will show some benefit in the quarter but forward looking demand is going to dwindle anyway."
2025-02-20T08:26:02Z,"why shouldn‚Äôt people hate it, the US government is being dismantled and sold for parts and Apple is happily complying with the fascists hoping to be a the oligarchs‚Äô table, fuck ‚Äòem"
2025-02-19T18:43:50Z,"&gt; where they could donate a million to a bevy of programs today

They did, well, at least their CEO recently donated that million to a guy that _totally_ shares their alleged values. Like DEI, inclusion, equal rights, etc."
2025-02-19T17:55:08Z,Just passing it on to the European buyers...
2025-02-19T23:38:08Z,"That is not how pricing works. If Apple could make more money by raising prices in Europe, they would have done so already."
2025-02-19T18:14:47Z,It‚Äôs because it‚Äôs just an excuse to raise pricing. People acting like companies raising their products pricing is the results of tariffs when it‚Äôs the result of greed masked behind the excuse of ‚Äúbut muh tariffs‚Äù
2025-02-19T23:41:41Z,"Whatever market conditions are, Apple will price the latest iPhone at whatever price maximizes profit. If that profit maximizing price is $500 in the absence of tariffs, and $600 with tariffs, then yes, the tariffs are responsible for the price increase."
2025-02-19T17:18:49Z,This might shrink Apple's profit margin from 55% to 54%. Let me go play a tiny violin to celebrate their sacrifice.

2025-02-20T02:16:14Z,"An ipad pro costs less than a 16 pro max lol. The latter has a 50% margin for the cost of production excluding development, logistics and what not. 

60% for the ipad seems extremely unlikely. 

Profit tmk comes from user services and spec upgrades (the higher tiers with chip, ram, ssd)"
2025-02-20T11:44:54Z,"High margin Products are subsidizing low margin products. If you buy a base model macbook air, mac mini or iMac, apple does not make much money if any at all, it is offset by the insane prices for storage and ram upgrades of the higher end models."
2025-02-20T10:15:50Z,"not the ipad but

AirTags: easily 80% plus - its just a battery, casing, and an antenna, BoM is prolly like $0.5-1 but they sell one for, what, $30?

AirPods: again low BoM, probably $10 or less, but the Pros sell for $200+

Apple Pencil

And any of their premium devices (specced out macbook pro) have a huge rise in margin"
2025-02-19T18:56:21Z,Exactly
2025-02-19T17:42:49Z,For real; they make over 26 percent of their revenue on subscriptions.
2025-02-20T00:06:17Z,Hurry and release the new Airs before prices go up.
2025-02-20T01:10:34Z,Companies should pass on the tariff to the customers. Make them feel the stupidity of this admin.

2025-02-19T20:11:36Z,"Apple doesn't pay tarrifs based on their retail prices, but based on the costs of the raw goods (which in their case are fully assembled laptops). So depending on their margin, it would probably be closer to something like \~30$"
2025-02-19T20:17:07Z,"No, they don‚Äôt lmfao. Look this up. The tariff is applied against the price of the device. Apple can choose to absorb that, or markup the price to accommodate it.¬†

Also what are you even trying to say? That the cost of materials is $50? LOL. Better tell Apple, because their margins on hardware are 35%.

Edit: I suppose my initial comment was confusing. When I said ‚Äúcost of goods,‚Äù I meant the price of the device. If Apple is planning to sell it for $500, then a tariff of $50 will be there.¬†"
2025-02-19T20:51:24Z,"&gt;Also what are you even trying to say? That the cost of materials is $50? LOL. Better tell Apple, because their margins on hardware are 35%.

That 35% is almost exactly matches what I used in the calculation:

500$ \* 0.65 = 325$ \* 10% import tariff = 32.5$ \~= 30$.

As far as I can see the import fees are however applied to the import price, not the expected retail price. So if I as a business would import a 1000$ device from China, and resell it for 1500$, I would have to pay 10% \* 1000$ = 100$ import tariffs, not 150$ as explained in this post: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tariffs-retail-prices-consumers-know-140500524.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tariffs-retail-prices-consumers-know-140500524.html) 

But note that I am not from the USA, so I indeed might be incorrect, in which case I would like to learn how it actually works."
2025-02-19T17:43:56Z,Trumpflation coming soon!!!!
2025-02-19T17:31:09Z,"Well Tim Cook supported Trump, so this should come as a no surprise to them."
2025-02-19T17:26:59Z,"Theres a strategy for ya. Nah trump, we wont raise prices. Your tariffs will be completely ineffective, get repealed, then we make record profits once they are gone by not raising prices. Trump looks like a dumbass and everyone profits long term and gets nothing but good press out of it."
2025-02-19T17:45:31Z,How does holding prices steady hurt Trump?  It would seem to help him as inflation is very unpopular with voters.
2025-02-19T19:21:51Z,"I guess the theory is they avoid ever onshoring production, do not see a customer base drop in raw volume sales relative to inflation, then just waiting out the admin?

I‚Äôm not sure. All I know is their US unit sales of the 16 were not stellar by their desires, and the VR sets were not stellar sellers either. I think Apple is more concerned about keeping people in the ecosystem and growing the customer base, so eating it now, and keeping production abroad, means that in the end they still will get lower labor costs, the tariffs eventually leave, and then they can raise prices down the road without having lost customers in this phase.

Trump thinks tariffs 1.) make companies produce everything here, and 2.) make some foreign country pay us money. Obviously 2 isn‚Äôt true, but if the tariff is high enough and lasts long enough number one can benefit a company. If Apple believes they can wait out the admin they keep the lower labor costs."
2025-02-20T08:05:44Z,How long before people are driving up north to Canada to afford electronics like they do with prescription meds.
2025-02-20T11:51:07Z,Probably not Canadian prices are even worse without tariffs.
2025-02-20T10:54:28Z,I don‚Äôt mind paying tRUMP‚Äôs freeDUMB tax. And neither does half the country who sold out democracy for the promise of cheap eggs.
2025-02-20T16:42:45Z,Sales will plummet worldwide as Trump makes the USA the most hated country on earth.
2025-02-20T01:58:14Z,"They just passed on the cost to iPhone SE consumers, basically."
2025-02-21T04:40:25Z,"They aren‚Äôt absorbing it, they‚Äôre simply getting their margins elsewhere, spread out across their oligopoly."
2025-02-19T18:35:50Z,"I mean, they‚Äôve got the margins.

Kinda wish they would relocate to Canada, though."
2025-02-19T21:11:38Z,and get hit with 25% tariffs???
2025-02-19T18:35:58Z,Left has been saying for months this will be passed on to consumers. Apple smart enough to know there are other options. Now figure out how to make them here only increase price by 5% and employee a ton of people. Almost like tariffs work. I will now take all your downvotes from people who don‚Äôt understand economics and trade.
2025-02-19T19:50:53Z,Economist here.  You're an idiot if you think MacBook Pros will ever be made in the U.S. at scale again.  Please tell me how I don't understand economics and trade so I can post my degrees.
2025-02-19T21:09:14Z,"The worst product of the internet was it providing imbeciles an outlet for their nonsense.

2025-02-19T13:31:49Z,"Wasn't this supposed to be a feature back with iphone X or 11? I swear there were articles saying it's possible hardware-wise, but is software locked"
2025-02-19T13:32:52Z,iPhone 12 and up can already reverse wireless charge the MagSafe battery pack.
2025-02-19T13:51:17Z,"Yeah the article mentions the iPhone 12 did it with the battery puck. The iPhone 11 actually had some of the hardware as well but was unfinished.

https://9to5mac.com/2019/09/20/iphone-11-pro-bilateral-wireless-charging-board/

The original rumors stated that the charging efficiency (speed/heat/etc) were not up to Apple standards so they scrapped it at the time."
2025-02-19T14:06:30Z,"If this allows this feature for third party battery packs, I can finally retire my Lightning MagSafe battery pack since Apple seems to have forgotten they made these"
2025-02-19T21:48:51Z,"At least this one seems to support the battery widget. Not sure about the reverse charging though.

2025-02-19T17:19:52Z,"Yeah, you're memory isn't crazy they have been talking about this for at least 5 years now.

TBH while this would be great in a pinch, I'm not sure I would love putting even more cycles on my iPhone battery."
2025-02-19T15:09:36Z,Samsung launched it in 2019
2025-02-19T15:31:11Z,Huwei launched it a year earlier. Not really on topic but it‚Äôs an interesting factoid.
2025-02-19T15:43:09Z,"Standard Apple leak syndrome.  Apple sometimes gets it into their heads they are going to do Feature Y or Product Y, *eventually*.  Until *eventually* happens they test it on every new model until the executives finally give the thumbs up based on criteria only they know.  Or the EU legally forces them to in the case of the annual USB-C rumors.


The good of this?  It means Apple is making sure when they drop these features they are well tested.


The downside of this?  It means every years we get leaks about these tests with leakers going ‚ÄúThis is the year!‚Äù for the tenth year in a row.


One year we‚Äôll get reverse charging because Apple is clearly testing it for years for whatever reason.  Only Apple executives know if this is the  year we‚Äôll finally see it in production."
2025-02-19T13:30:58Z,"It‚Äôs a nifty feature for the AirPods I‚Äôd definitely take. Could charge the phone and AirPods at the same time with one cord, making traveling easier. ¬†"
2025-02-19T13:32:59Z,Cool if it worked also with the watch.
2025-02-19T13:38:59Z,"Yeah the AirPods aren‚Äôt really that much of an issue, just take turns with that one cable‚Ä¶ it charges fast enough‚Ä¶ the watch needing that very specific extra cable or charger is the issue‚Ä¶"
2025-02-19T13:40:59Z,"Yep I hate this when traveling and USB-C really changed this paradigm for me. 1 cable that charges everything is awesome, a second cable that charges the watch kind of breaks the magic."
2025-02-19T13:47:03Z,I bought a 3 in 1 folding wireless charging hub to get around that issue. Obviously it‚Äôs not a perfect solution but it does allow you to just bring one cable and still charge everything. And because it folds up it really doesn‚Äôt take up a ton of space.
2025-02-19T13:49:34Z,"Could you share which one? I could maybe get into this if it can double as a bed side clock with the iPhone StandBy mode. 

It‚Äôs unbelievable to me how some companies charging 100$ for something able to do this."
2025-02-19T14:40:03Z,"I bought these 2 and have been happy with them.¬†

https://a.co/d/7C11dBz

https://a.co/d/gKXl9nf"
2025-02-19T14:31:48Z,"It‚Äôs pretty believable to me for a 3 in 1 to cost around that, when the three things separated cost around that."
2025-02-19T14:10:03Z,"AirPods also work with Apple Watch chargers. Not that this would change how many cables you carry, but it makes things a little more flexible. It‚Äôs also good for those with mismatched AirPods &amp; phone cables."
2025-02-19T17:28:48Z,Not mine. AFAIK the watch charger only works with the watch.
2025-02-19T18:28:50Z,"Nah, it definitely works for AirPods, but it could be to do with the model. Mine are the Pro 2 (lightning case), and it works."
2025-02-19T18:01:08Z,"This would be the one

(Who‚Äôs charging their AirPods case that frequently)

The real solution here is Apple needs to update the watch to charge via Qi 2

The Qi 2 standard (basically MagSafe) has specific affordances for smart watches, yet no one has made use of it yet"
2025-02-19T13:48:53Z,"I agree it‚Äôs a cool feature and maybe helpful in an emergency, but am I the only one who never runs out of battery on my AirPods? I feel like they last such a long time"
2025-02-19T13:57:38Z,"Depends on how much do you beat it. I wear them all the time listening to music and talking on the phone, so for me they die pretty soon"
2025-02-19T15:21:15Z,Are we not doing phrasing anymore?
2025-02-19T14:08:53Z,"&gt;Depends on how much do you beat it.

Hmm ü§î"
2025-02-19T14:04:01Z,I‚Äôm on them almost all day and the case usually has two-thirds of battery remaining.
2025-02-19T14:34:46Z,"Just want to point out that you only need one cable to charge AirPods and iPhone atm. Personally, I think it would be great for charging the Watch while traveling because that requires a separate cable."
2025-02-19T15:33:06Z,You can not charge them both at the same time with one cable. Thats what the redditor was reffering to.
2025-02-19T13:49:32Z,"I would have loved that so much. No extra charger for the watch and AirPods needed.¬†

And the phones are capable of, the MagSafe battery pack is being charged wirelessly already.¬†"
2025-02-19T15:33:06Z,How would it work with current AirPods? They both have the same polarity of magnets so they repel
2025-02-19T18:01:58Z,You already only need to take one cable?
2025-02-19T18:27:29Z,"The MagSafe ring in the phone and the magnets in the AirPods case mean this won‚Äôt be possible without a redesign of one or both

The magnets will literally repel each other"
2025-02-19T21:47:36Z,"Yeah I'm not updating specifically for it since I have a 16 pro, but I'd be a great little ""oh yeah that's a new thing"" when I update in the future."
2025-02-19T13:48:09Z,"This is one of the only features I actually miss from android, which became available roughly *6 years ago*. No idea why Apple has dragged their feet on this."
2025-02-19T14:55:19Z,"Because it relies on doubling down on inefficient wireless charging - it's one of those ""makes good demo, but nobody really bothers unless they're really screwed"" features.

I know Android folk with this feature who never use it, wouldn't be surprised if that were the norm most of the time"
2025-02-19T15:49:52Z,I've used it a bunch.. ironically every time with my wife's iPhone when it's on the verge of death because she's apparently allergic to charging her phone.
2025-02-20T02:33:38Z,Are married to my wife too?
2025-02-19T17:11:05Z,"With my OnePlus, I almost always carry a C to C cable in case my earphones or vape die while out and about. But when I don't do that (especially when going out with friends) it's nice to be able to get a mates charge up high enough they can take some final pics or call an Uber or whatever via reverse wireless charging

Though it is an extremely slow and inefficient process. You lose far more battery than the other person gains, like substantially"
2025-02-19T17:29:01Z,"Yeah, I think (napkin IIRC math here) it's like a 2.5x cost - so giving 10% to another identical device uses 25% of your own battery or something ridiculous like that"
2025-02-19T15:25:45Z,It‚Äôll also wear the battery out way faster. Then people will start complaining battery life on the new models suck
2025-02-19T15:23:14Z,"You could ask this about USB OTG, 120hz OLED, in-screen touchID, and many other features."
2025-02-19T16:38:55Z,I‚Äôll give you a hint: $. Why would people buy Apple‚Äôs expensive chargers then?
2025-02-19T18:55:30Z,"In fairness, I had Samsung for 9 years until a few months ago and the only times I‚Äôve used this feature are when 1) a friend or colleague wants a boost or 2) my manager realises I have this and keeps bugging me for it. I have never needed it myself, and in all occasions it unsurprisingly fucks your battery.

I don‚Äôt miss it."
2025-02-19T14:11:59Z,The iPhone has had the ability since the 12. They just software locked it to the MagSafe battery pack.
2025-02-19T13:41:35Z,Unrelated: two nights ago when I was working a night shift I wanted to charge my max pro 16 with a powerbank (85%) via cable since there was no outlet close to my bed‚Ä¶ well next morning the powerbank was at 100% and my phone at 5% ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
2025-02-19T14:58:49Z,"for future reference, I believe (strong emphasis on believe) the correct way to avoid this issue is to: connect the cable to the power bank, press the power button on the power bank, and then connect the iPhone

That‚Äôs what works for me 100% with my anker power bank."
2025-02-19T17:52:26Z,Yes that's been the default way to do it right since the very first powerbank haha
2025-02-19T14:07:38Z,"Lmao, we think you‚Äôre going to love it"
2025-02-19T14:38:48Z,"One of the downsides of USB-C is that there are so many different implementations of the standard (PD 1-3.1, every OEM having their own charging spec, USB-C just being used in place of USB-A, etc) that establishing which device should be the charger and which should be charged gets difficult at times. That's one of the downsides of both sides of the cable being the same. Before, it was obvious which side charged but now there's an actual negotiation going on between devices."
2025-02-19T14:23:32Z,That feature is something I really miss back in the days when I used Samsung.
2025-02-19T13:55:11Z,This has been a rumor every year since iPhone 12 hasn‚Äôt it?
2025-02-19T14:21:09Z,Since the Huawei Mate 20 Pro I guess... so like 2018.
2025-02-19T13:52:12Z,Woau 8 years old feature
2025-02-19T14:37:46Z,Gonna turn on the feature flag as it supposed to be like this since iPhone11
2025-02-20T10:57:14Z,"Speaking as a longtime Samsung customer who had this for years, useless feature.

For one, it‚Äôs very slow.

And you have to leave your phone face down with the buds or watch or other phone perfectly.

Other than seeing if it works, I never used it.

Now, if your AirPods or watch could stick to the phone magnetically, maybe it would be remotely useful."
2025-02-19T14:07:22Z,"It will be fun for apple to claim that another longstanding android feature is brand new and exciting and so much better than android.

I love my apple products, but we gotta stop pretending the premium features they're dropping aren't normal features on android phones that have been around for the better part of the last decade (first introduced in 2018 on the Huawei Mate 20 Pro).

Still blows my mind that an extra terabyte or two of SSD costs $400-$800.

Still blows my mind that most iphones are 60hz, instead of 90hz or 120hz.

Still blows my mind that they *just* moved their base ram to 16 gb."
2025-02-19T14:14:01Z,"Me too. I Never thought I‚Äôd say this, but it‚Äôs time to move to Android and Samsung"
2025-02-19T14:39:33Z,"I recently did this dance and ended up coming back.

Android has the better hardware for sure, but I found that the software is missing a lot of these little day to day things that genuinely improve my life. For example, location based travel time in calendar. I tried explaining this feature to an Android loving friend and it blew their mind.

Also, the power of Siri Shortcuts. There‚Äôs an app for Android that aims to do automations, but it isn‚Äôt nearly as robust. For example, I‚Äôve got a Siri shortcut that makes api requests to slack to update my in-office status when I connect and disconnect from office WiFi. And one that, when I connect to home WiFi, copies my recent photos to the NAS.

And say what you will about Siri, but when I ask it to remind me to get toilet paper next time I‚Äôm near the grocery store, it creates a reminder that triggers when I arrive within a wide radius around the grocery store.

I plan to try again when the pixel 9 pro goes on super deep discount, as I hear Gemini can finally interact with apps, and that was also something I missed."
2025-02-20T02:22:10Z,"That's the problem, there is no perfect OS, unfortunately. On iOS I miss a clipboard, split screen, notification channels, volume split, among other things.

I hope that one day such a system will come into existence."
2025-02-19T15:25:26Z,"It could just be that software sucks everywhere these days. There's a lot about Apple that I want to love because the concept is awesome and I find myself making excuses for the terrible execution.

And with AI coding looming I don't think things are getting better any time soon."
2025-02-19T14:17:42Z,"Screw Samsung. Pixel phones are better because Samsung hasn't had a chance to smear their software all over it.

No other company has the combination of amazing hardware and god-awful software that Samsung does. I stay away from anything they make with a hint of an operating system."
2025-02-19T14:23:18Z,Pixel phones are having issues right now too though. My mom is on her 4th pixel 9. Something keeps going wrong with the SIM card reader.
2025-02-19T14:45:58Z,Surprised she's not on an eSIM
2025-02-19T14:50:30Z,Me too! She just got her 4th one and it came with a new SIM card. I would definitely have thought it would be on eSIM.
2025-02-19T16:27:50Z,Cmon Apple goddamn.  You should've BEEN added this.  And put TouchID on the fuckin power button.  I love it on my MacBook Air.
2025-02-19T17:54:36Z,"As much as I don‚Äôt mind FaceID, it has kind of gone to shit and I end up typing in my code anyway. I‚Äôd love my phone to have TouchID on the power button like my 10th gen iPad. Especially on the side where the button is now, I hold it there anyway, so it‚Äôs just a matter of sliding my finger over a bit. 
I use my MBA infrequently enough at this point that I always have to type my password anyway, but when I was using it all the time, that was by far my favorite feature lol took me forever to figure out unlocking with my watch though, and that still only works maybe 1/3 of the time. 

I do very much enjoy unlocking my phone with my watch and the other way around. That‚Äôs not real consistent, either, but it‚Äôs nice when it works and isn‚Äôt a huge deal when it doesn‚Äôt."
2025-02-19T21:34:00Z,"üíØ this is a layup for Apple, they should've implemented this years ago"
2025-02-19T23:34:16Z,"I have an iPhone 15 and don‚Äôt understand why it isn‚Äôt on this phone, honestly."
2025-02-19T14:29:07Z,"Not something I'd use daily (because chances are, I'd prioritize phone battery level over any peripheral) but having the feature and option to do so would be nice when I know for sure the phone can get through the day after giving AirPods a bit of boost. (Still rare for me to use up the whole batter of AirPods though.)"
2025-02-19T18:47:26Z,"It‚Äôs never going to be designed as a feature for topping up on the go. 

I see this being pitched more as a feature where you no longer have to pack an Apple Watch charger when you travel. 

In fact I wouldn‚Äôt put it past Apple to only engage the reverse wireless charging while the iPhone is plugged into power so you don‚Äôt accidentally rundown your phone while it‚Äôs in your pocket or something"
2025-02-19T13:33:15Z,"That‚Äôs a revolution, I mean for apple"
2025-02-19T13:45:41Z,"This has been rumoured for years, maybe they‚Äôll finally get it out there."
2025-02-19T14:16:37Z,They can cancel this feature 1 week before the launch
2025-02-19T15:28:43Z,One of the favorite things about my work phone (Pixel) is that I can charge my airpods and pixel buds as I charge my phone with a cable.
2025-02-19T18:10:19Z,"If you‚Äôre imaging a situation where one iPhone can reverse wireless charge another this plainly isn‚Äôt for that. 

The magnets in each phone make that a non starter. 

Even just the magnets in the current AirPods case won‚Äôt let them lineup. 

I suspect this is a feature for charging the watch while traveling and will be paired with the next generation watch being updated to support Qi 2 charging (the Qi2 spec has support for non flat- smaller devices)"
2025-02-19T23:50:45Z,"ring ring... *clack* 

""yes? Oh, it's for you Apple. 2018 is calling."""
2025-02-20T01:54:08Z,I‚Äôd love this to charge my watch and pods on the go since I use both daily
2025-02-19T16:04:38Z,"What?? It's not possible on iPhone? I been using this for atleast 5 years now. Always use reverse charging for earbuds and smartwatch when traveling.

OnePlus 13 released on January have **100w wired charging, 50w wireless charging, 10w reverse wireless charging, 5w reverse wired charging.** All while having 6000 mah battery capacity."
2025-02-19T13:32:39Z,"I don't really see the benefit in this other than for what Apple already supports with charging the MagSafe battery. Maybe they are expanding this to support other batteries but seems like an odd ""leak"" just test that with existing phones. 

You couldn't use this for AirPods Pro because they support MagSafe, so they have the same magnets as the phone and won't line up."
2025-02-19T13:45:56Z,"This, and wifi sharing, are the last 2 android features I miss ever since I switched. Super useful when traveling or borrowing a single cable from somebody. But of course, I could charge my Samsung watch with it. Not sure the same would apply to my Apple Watch

Also, the AirPod pro case doesn‚Äôt need to sit right in the middle of a pad to charge, so I think Apple would come up with a solution fairly easily but who knows"
2025-02-19T13:57:15Z,"Yeah I keep a small USB-C cable on me when I travel in case I need to charge my AirPods. With the efficiency loss of wireless I don't want to lose anymore phone battery. Same with Apple Watch I bought a tiny little charger that just has a USB-C port sticking out that I can plug into my phone and charge it. 

I can see how wireless would be nice in a pinch but you'd really have to place them perfectly and then not be able to really use your phone. 

What is wifi sharing if I might ask, not really sure what that is."
2025-02-19T14:43:30Z,"What is WiFi sharing?

Is it being able to share the WiFi credentials when the devices are nearby? If so, iOS has been able to do this for quite some time, but I think it relies on airdrop (I could be wrong)."
2025-02-19T15:34:29Z,"Nope!

On android devices (maybe all? At least my Samsung) you can connect to a secure wifi network and share that connection with other devices. 

For example, if I pay for wifi at an Airport or in an airplane, I can simply share my connection from my phone to a laptop. 

It‚Äôs the same as hotspot, but works when you‚Äôre on wifi."
2025-02-19T18:48:43Z,"If this is a real thing then my bet would be as a feature for charging the watch while traveling. 

As you say the magnets make it a non starter for AirPods or other iPhones."
2025-02-19T15:54:12Z,My Samsung FE has this lol
2025-02-19T13:50:24Z,Just fix and finally release AirPower.
2025-02-19T14:03:06Z,I heard the same rumor for like a year before iPhone 11 came out and look where we are now üôÑ
2025-02-19T14:19:35Z,Apprently apple is releasing a new OS main version this year and also new phones according to Leaker
2025-02-19T14:22:03Z,"This has been rumored for the last 8 years. It would be awesome if this actually came to fruition in the next release.

Obviously it wouldn't be efficient or practical, but in a pinch it would be a great way to give your pods some juice."
2025-02-19T15:16:10Z,How will that work with MagSafe?
2025-02-19T17:17:38Z,"I have it on my phone, nothing but a gimmick, I never use it. Even in an emergency when someone else‚Äôs phone is low it's easier to go into a shop/business and ask to borrow a charger for 5 mins."
2025-02-20T10:08:59Z,What exactly is the point of this feature?
2025-02-20T19:44:52Z,Brand New invention yet to be done on a mobile device.
2025-02-20T21:21:19Z,Had this on Samsung devices‚Ä¶ you want to know how many times I used it in 7 years? Once. Just to see what it was like. It‚Äôs dumb
2025-02-19T19:57:19Z,1 news story for every feature removed. For maximum clicks.
2025-02-19T22:51:29Z,At least the article headline tells the story.   No clicks from me. üò¨
2025-02-20T01:54:47Z,"I wouldn't call this a feature removed (as OLED is objectively superior to LCD) but these tech ""news"" outlets publishing one article for every single change or feature of the 16e is annowing5"
2025-02-20T07:11:42Z,"Yes. Apple no longer sells any iPhone with a home button, with Touch ID, with a 4.7 inch display, Apple no longer sells small iPhones, all iPhones have USB-C, all iPhones have an OLED display, an action button, there are no iPhones with a mute switch being sold, Apple discontinued the last iPhone that showed the time in the middle of the top bar.

Hope I exhausted them."
2025-02-20T07:22:29Z,iPhone 15 still has the mute switch.
2025-02-19T21:54:38Z,"That's cool and all, but how about we finally get around to giving them all 120hz displays since you know, they are all $600+ now. Some Budget Android devices half this price already have them. But just one more selling point for the Pro's. Honestly, if the MBA and Regular 16's had 120hz displays already, I wouldn't have a 16 Pro Max or a MacBook Pro. But that's Apple's point exactly."
2025-02-20T08:57:17Z,"Yeah, it‚Äôs absurd that Apple is still selling 60hz screens at these prices.

I was going to buy a MacBook Air. Got a pro instead mostly because of the screen.

I want an iPad mini. I think it would be a great travel device and just around town device. But paying Apple prices for an lcd 60hz screen turns me off.

But I don‚Äôt want a freaking pro that costs a fortune and has a chip that can launch missles to read and watch Netflix on other."
2025-02-20T21:09:37Z,Yeah I get that. I actually like my 15‚Äù MBA (work computer) better than my personal 16MBP. It‚Äôs so heavy and thick and I don‚Äôt even utilize 90% of its power. But I want that 120hz display. I don‚Äôt even use the additional ports.¬†
2025-02-20T23:51:36Z,"I have an M2 MBA and an M2 iPad Air. Both have 60hz displays.

Weirdly enough, the 60hz display on the Mac doesn‚Äôt bother me as much as it does on the iPad. And even weirder: my old iPhone 8 Plus‚Äôs 60hz display doesn‚Äôt bother me either. But when I go on my sister‚Äôs 15 Plus, there it is. Just‚Ä¶ sluggish.

I‚Äôm kinda upset the iPad Air doesn‚Äôt at least have a Mini LED display though."
2025-02-22T22:36:56Z,pretty sure my eyes only refresh at 60ps because i can‚Äôt tell this difference
2025-02-20T01:42:36Z,"This. Until the lower end model has 120hz, it‚Äôs still a waste of money."
2025-02-20T02:12:33Z,"Normies don't care about 120hz, full stop."
2025-02-20T02:33:34Z,They think they don‚Äôt until they see it. Case in point: every single non-Pro iPhone user that uses my phone for 10s.
2025-02-20T06:03:47Z,I went from pro my whole life to non pro for iPhone 16. Honestly I couldn‚Äôt tell the difference. I do miss the always on display though.
2025-02-20T07:10:36Z,Ok boomer
2025-02-20T03:05:38Z,Because they more than likely haven't experienced it. You don't know better until you've seen it.
2025-02-20T02:17:19Z,"Everyone always compares it to android. If people want a 120hz screen that bad for cheap they can get an android.
iPhones have a lot going for it than a screen. And most people don‚Äôt care anyway."
2025-02-20T03:04:33Z,"People compare it to Android because that's literally the only thing you can compare it to. And not Android specifically, but the hardware manufactures that use it. And iPhone users don't want Android devices just to get hardware that should be the normal for Apple in 2025, even on a $600 device. Just like it's a joke that Apple just bumped up entry Macs to 16GB ram, only so they could push and sell Apple Intelligence, otherwise we'd still be stuck with 8GB ram in 2025 on $1000+ machines. Apple doesn't use some special hardware that's only available to them, which they sell to you as a premium. Trust me. I love my Apple devices, but it's no secret Apple screws their customers at their base tiers.  Some would say they screw their customers at all tiers. ""Apple Tax"""
2025-02-19T20:03:52Z,"I‚Äôm really glad there‚Äôs one unified design language again.

¬†
I love the Home Button, but once iPhone X was released it was time for the Home Button to eventually be replaced. I wish it had been way sooner, but I‚Äôm happy anyways now that it‚Äôs all future stuff across all iPhones and all iPads.

All screen and Face ID on every device. I loved Touch ID and the Home Button, but it‚Äôs time to embrace the future and move on. (No need for two options either.)"
2025-02-19T20:59:18Z,I‚Äôve got a pixel for work and it has an under screen fingerprint reader which works amazing in conjunction with face unlock. I‚Äôd love to have both on the iPhone.¬†
2025-02-19T21:46:10Z,"I don‚Äôt want both

Apple is about simplicity. They pick one tech that‚Äôs on its ascendency and they relentlessly improve on it.¬†

Steve Jobs said that in 2010

Edit: this website is full of actual idiots. 16 dislikes because you morons have zero clue how Apple works lmfao"
2025-02-19T22:44:28Z,"Except when they don‚Äôt. They haven‚Äôt relentlessly improved on the cameras. People always complain on the over processing, they haven‚Äôt relentlessly improved on the UI, iOS 18 is full of bugs and many of the new additions feel like bloatware. And don‚Äôt even get me started on Siri lol. Nothing wrong with adding a fingerprint sensor to the screen, or even to the power button like on the iPads."
2025-02-19T22:48:17Z,[deleted]
2025-02-20T10:09:11Z,"I see plenty of posts on TikTok of regular people complaining about the iPhones camera being over processed, and most of them have hundreds of thousands of likes."
2025-02-20T00:54:12Z,"You‚Äôre hearing but you‚Äôre not listening. 

People aren‚Äôt going to say ‚Äúgod Apple over processes so much!‚Äù 

Instead, I‚Äôve heard many people say ‚ÄúI like the way pictures look on Samsung‚Äù or ‚Äúmy friend has a pixel and her pictures always look better than mine‚Äù"
2025-02-20T10:41:44Z,Yeah I hear the opposite
2025-02-20T10:41:16Z,"Lmfao what the hell are you talking about? The conversation is on Touch ID vs Face ID.¬†

Face ID has been upgraded numerous times since launch, from faster speeds, to wider angles, to 360 orientation use, to usage with face respirators, shrinking components, etc

Your rant also completely ignored all the stuff Apple has focused on in their ascendancy. For example, satellites. Apple is the leader of the satellite smartphone ¬†revolution, and has relentlessly improved it since launch. You‚Äôre a fool if you think otherwise that Apple doesn‚Äôt pick technologies and goes with them, rather than accommodating everything. Stop seeking likes on social media and watch a few Steve Jobs videos. You might learn how Apple works and why it does the things it does for products

&gt;Nothing wrong with adding a fingerprint sensor to the screen, or even to the power button like on the iPads

Nope, sorry. Complexity will always result in subpar options.¬†"
2025-02-19T22:53:15Z,Congrats on having zero reading comprehension while replying to the comment above yours.
2025-02-20T00:58:53Z,Congrats on defending a trillion dollar company. I‚Äôm sure Tim will personally give you a new iPhone this September.
2025-02-20T10:42:21Z,"Nah, don‚Äôt be dumb. You completely misread my comment"
2025-02-20T10:42:26Z,Thank you ffs
2025-02-19T23:16:05Z,So when can you be counted on moving to an Android OS phone?
2025-02-20T00:56:28Z,Not anytime soon. I paid full price for my 15PM and I plan on using it for its entire lifespan. But android has caught my eye more than ever. My next phone might be an android idk. I guess we‚Äôll see how Apple improves until then.
2025-02-20T10:42:42Z,"Good, bye."
2025-02-20T21:52:39Z,"I could see the possibility of them adopting both, at least in the Pro models. Both Face ID and Touch ID have instances where they‚Äôre impractical, but rarely do you encounter both at once. Having the option of either would be nice.

That said, my guess is they were working on it during the pandemic (when people encountered Face ID working poorly with a mask), but by the time they had under-screen Touch ID ready to roll out, most people weren‚Äôt wearing masks anymore."
2025-02-21T00:22:21Z,Face ID already accommodates respirators. There is no need for Touch ID anymore
2025-02-21T04:00:09Z,It still doesn‚Äôt work well with masks.
2025-02-19T22:32:08Z,Every iPhone should have 120hz refresh rates.
2025-02-20T08:58:33Z,And iPads and MacBooks while you‚Äôre at it.
2025-02-19T20:00:10Z,"Get ready later this year for


All iPhone Now Feature Type-C Port"
2025-02-19T20:08:26Z,"They already all do, but yeah, the clickbait tabloid crap is annoying"
2025-02-19T20:14:20Z,Wasn‚Äôt it only for EU? Good if true then
2025-02-19T20:15:16Z,The international iPhone lineup is last year‚Äôs model plus this year‚Äôs model line up.¬†
2025-02-19T20:17:16Z,"No, there hasn‚Äôt been a difference there.¬†"
2025-02-19T20:41:29Z,"Nope, iPhone SE was delisted in EU like 2 months ago because of the lightning port"
2025-02-19T20:13:06Z,All new phones? 13s are still a part of the lineup
2025-02-19T20:15:37Z,No they arent
2025-02-19T21:06:15Z,In the US or maybe Apple directly? They‚Äôre available through retailers still
2025-02-20T01:26:06Z,"While I think Lightning cables should have been phased out in the 2010s, this is massive."
2025-02-20T08:02:49Z,With 60Hz‚Ä¶
2025-02-20T23:33:46Z,Wasn‚Äôt the 11 the last iPhone to use an LCD ?
2025-02-21T09:32:36Z,iPhone SE used to have LCD as well.
2025-02-19T20:20:44Z,"What about at least 90hz screens that even $200 androids have?

It‚Äôs 2025‚Ä¶"
2025-02-19T20:31:32Z,Why would Apple bother? People still buy the shit out of iPhones regardless what the refresh rate is.
2025-02-19T20:40:54Z,Because it should be an option for people who want it. The base iPhones *start* at $800.
2025-02-19T22:35:16Z,"That‚Äôs not the point. From a profit perspective, as a business, Apple has little incentive to add all the features and continue to segment their lineup because *people still buy them regardless.* Do WE, Reddit nerds, think they should add these things? Yes! Does everyone else care? No, because they still buy them."
2025-02-19T23:42:14Z,Apple needs to move to a 3 year refresh cycle but only when it lines up with my 3 years because I‚Äôm the only customer that exists!!!
2025-02-19T23:39:59Z,Your mom starts at $200
2025-02-20T10:28:09Z,"You're balling high, even 60‚Ç¨ phones have 90 Hz screens now."
2025-02-19T19:59:02Z,But not 120hz. That's only for the non-peasants apparently (even tho 200 dollar Androids have had this for years now)
2025-02-19T22:16:19Z,Putting 120hz on the 16e is like a slap on the face for 16 users.
2025-02-19T22:56:51Z,Yeah surely nobody expected the 6e to get it lmao
2025-02-20T00:32:34Z,No but we did expect Magsafe at the very least. Like wtf.
2025-02-20T01:43:28Z,Wait.. what?! lol
2025-02-20T02:03:39Z,"16E doesn't come with Magsafe. For a $600 phone in 2025, that's unacceptable."
2025-02-20T02:31:50Z,Agreed. Brutal.
2025-02-20T03:16:27Z,"Yea and I know usually the people who buy a budget phone like this wouldn't care but I disagree. I don't consider $600 a ""budget"" phone so this won't just be a boomers and old people phone. I really wanna know why they didn't include Magsafe. Surely it couldn't have increased the costs that much. Or Apple could have absorbed the costs."
2025-02-19T20:04:09Z,And no AOD because FU that's why
2025-02-19T20:25:40Z,As if they were ever gonna add features to this phone that aren‚Äôt in the 16
2025-02-20T00:31:08Z,The 16 should get that too
2025-02-19T20:04:19Z,Artificial upgrades lol
2025-02-19T20:46:00Z,"Apple is good at introducing 2017 stuff as ultra pro max. They can‚Äòt sell anything new, so they stack up features from 8 years ago and release them slowly and for a premium price tag."
2025-02-19T20:04:17Z,"Then get an Android, nobody‚Äôs stopping you."
2025-02-19T20:06:32Z,It‚Äôs okay to critique the iPhone.
2025-02-19T20:10:49Z,"I never said it wasn‚Äôt? That‚Äôs the beauty of choice, no one is forcing you to buy an iPhone."
2025-02-19T20:58:16Z,Then buy the $200 android...? What's the problem?
2025-02-19T21:16:43Z,"Maybe you want iOS _and_ 120hz for not a ridiculous price?

You are paying $600+ for the phone. If a $200 one can have it, then you should expect the one that cost 3 times as much to have it."
2025-02-19T22:13:13Z,"Your $200 android might have a better display but it will be a brick in a year because of shit CPU and battery, and will receive 0 updates. The comparison makes no sense."
2025-02-19T23:11:27Z,"All Samsung phones now even the ones which are $150 like the A16 (which you can get for $100 if you don't get it from the Samsung website) come with 6-7 years updates. 

So what you are saying is true... in 2010."
2025-02-19T22:24:12Z,"You are missing the point. It's exactly what you are saying, if a shitty phone that can't have a decent chip CAN have 120hz it means it's NOT an expensive feature to have. Thus, a $600+ phones should also have it.

It's incredible how blind some people can be at Apple keeping features that should be basic by today's standards, just to make you spend $300+ more.

It's the same as the non Pro phones having only USB 2 speeds. It just shouldn't happen.

I'm sure you are one of those that defended the 64gb models because you don't _need_ more or you gladly pay for iCloud."
2025-02-19T21:57:12Z,"Haven‚Äôt you heard of ecosystem lock-in? iMessage? Pre-existing paid apps? 

God forbid someone wants to have an iPhone to be able to communicate with their friends and family properly and enjoy 120hz"
2025-02-19T22:23:25Z,Does the pro not exist for you or what?
2025-02-19T22:24:10Z,"does the concept of money, price, and cost not exist for you or what?"
2025-02-19T22:47:09Z,"Really? This is all that it is? You want more stuff for less money? 

Grow up."
2025-02-19T20:21:07Z,Came here because I knew someone would say this. üòÇüòÇ
2025-02-20T09:19:49Z,120hz when
2025-02-19T21:57:54Z,But no MagSafe. Genius.
2025-02-20T13:13:41Z,It‚Äôs fascinating how few people know about PWM flickering on OLED screens. It‚Äôs a shame there‚Äôs no LCD iPhone anymore. r/PWM_sensitive
2025-02-20T13:13:24Z,"Are you sure? I just checked and my iPhone 8
Still has an LCD screen ü§®üßêü§î"
2025-02-19T16:20:58Z,A handful of people are gonna be really upset
2025-02-20T01:10:40Z,And they‚Äôll all post here acting like it‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs problem.
2025-02-19T19:46:02Z,"""There are dozens of us! Dozens!"""
2025-02-19T16:23:26Z,Im never going back to fingerprints and passcodes again. Those systems are awful.
2025-02-19T16:45:29Z,Meh. Touch ID was excellent. I bet I type my passcode more often now than I did back in the day especially if I‚Äôm lying in bed.
2025-02-19T17:24:28Z,"This! I miss Touch ID, I get that a Face scan is more secure but not by much"
2025-02-19T19:24:19Z,"I know apple said odds of a false positive for Touch ID is 1/50000 compared to 1/million for Face ID, but I have seen family members unlock other phones with their faces. Meanwhile I have never heard of such a thing happening with Touch ID. 

Maybe someone could lift your fingerprint off a drinking glass like in spy movies but if someone was that desperate they'd use a $5 crowbar and the threat of violence like in that xkcd comic"
2025-02-19T21:42:47Z,I think the numbers are technically true. The problem is that family members can look really similar which means that it‚Äôs more likely that among those one in 1 million chances most of them are going to be with people that you‚Äôre related to.
2025-02-19T23:48:18Z,"Re: the family member thing

If your kid takes your phone to play games, the FaceID will detect that a face is there but it won‚Äôt unlock because it‚Äôs not your face. So you type in the passcode for them or tell them what your passcode is. The FaceID camera is still looking as it unlocks though, and will now register your kids face as the user‚Äôs face (your face). 

Do this enough times and it will train the algorithm to unlock when it detects your kids face. 

I‚Äôve also seen it happen with siblings and close friends."
2025-02-19T19:27:30Z,"Maybe ‚Äúnot by much‚Äù is a bad way to phrase it, the chances of someone having a fingerprint close enough to mine to break Touch ID are low enough to where I‚Äôm not concerned about it"
2025-02-20T07:34:05Z,Yes and I believe it has issues if you wear a face mask
2025-02-19T17:06:50Z,"I'm the opposite-- Apple's face scanners have never worked consistently for me, their fingerprint scanners have always been much better.

For me, FaceID is just an absolute downgrade. I have to type in my passcode *far* more often than I ever did on their TouchID systems."
2025-02-19T18:21:50Z,That‚Äôs crazy the face scanner has been flawless for me since it was invented
2025-02-20T05:59:44Z,"The problem is that it requires my active attention. I can‚Äôt count the times that I open (for instance) an Authenticator app, and look away to type my password on the other system, then look for the code only to find the app still locked. 

With TouchID it always did what I wanted and only when I wanted it."
2025-02-20T07:17:02Z,You can turn off ‚Äúrequire attention for Face ID‚Äù
2025-02-19T19:03:00Z,"Touch ID was the best shit ever created. Shit was so smooth. I wish they would bring it back, perhaps on the sleep/wake button."
2025-02-19T17:47:54Z,‚ÄûI hate Face ID‚Äú is probably my most spoken sentence ever since I‚Äôve gotten my iPhone XS in 2018.
2025-02-19T18:20:36Z,"At the price point they charge for Pro phones, _both_ should be there.

Face ID and a fingerprint reader either on the power button or an ultrasonic one under the screen would be ideal.

Even better if you could make it require both for some extra secure folder/app whatever if you wanted to."
2025-02-19T19:14:10Z,"&gt;passcodes

The police can legally force you to unlock your phone via biometrics but it isn't legal for them to force you to enter your passcode. That matters in a world where fascism is rising worldwide."
2025-02-19T19:23:12Z,Restart phone. Problem solved.
2025-02-19T21:27:00Z,Just click the power button 5 times
2025-02-19T22:52:46Z,"Or hold down power and volume until you see the shutdown slider. You don‚Äôt have to shut it down, but that screen disables biometric unlock until the passcode is entered."
2025-02-19T22:17:17Z,"Wow, TIL."
2025-02-20T04:45:54Z,"Even if the police CAN force you to enter your passcode, they can‚Äôt inject you with the memory of your passcode if you ‚Äúforgot‚Äù it."
2025-02-19T22:36:07Z,Click power button 5 times¬†
2025-02-20T14:55:15Z,"I want both on my phone tbh. Put the fingerprint scanner under screen or on the lock button + faceID. Let me choose which one, or require both for banking apps."
2025-02-19T16:58:58Z,"Fingerprints are massively better than faceid when done correctly, side mounted fingerprint\power button it peek, phones unlocked before it's full out your pocket, basically instant and no issues with glasses and hats"
2025-02-19T18:35:40Z,I‚Äôve never had issues with glasses.
2025-02-19T17:17:46Z,How has not included a finger print scanner on the side of the phone for the pro models??
2025-02-19T21:45:55Z,Why would they when underscreen finger print scanners exist
2025-02-20T12:26:23Z,Wasted internal space just for a redundancy.
2025-02-20T07:33:19Z,But you still require a passcode even if you have Face ID which it forces when your phone dies/is turned off
2025-02-19T22:19:53Z,I am one of them. I do not like the idea of face ID type things.
2025-02-19T23:52:31Z,I‚Äôm one of them. Sticking to my se 2 until something breaks. Then I‚Äôll get a new one off ebay or somewhere
2025-02-20T16:58:11Z,"I would love FaceID if it let us have more than 1 face. 

It‚Äôs just so annoying taking my wife‚Äôs phone and vice versa when there‚Äôs only 1 face. Have to use passcode because of that limitation."
2025-02-20T17:02:22Z,Have you tried setting up an alternate appearance?
2025-02-20T17:08:07Z,I think it‚Äôs for people who have different clothing (like masks or make up or glasses). It‚Äôs not for completely different person.
2025-02-20T17:09:49Z,"I‚Äôve heard it works. Might be worth a try.

Masks and glasses are a different thing. Those are setup elsewhere in FaceID settings."
2025-02-19T18:31:05Z,Only people with fingers.
2025-02-19T22:14:09Z,"&gt; A handful of people are gonna be really upset

I missed it during COVID when FaceID + N95 mask made that biometric useless for a year"
2025-02-20T05:11:45Z,My wife is one of them
2025-02-20T07:28:18Z,My grandmother :(
2025-02-19T16:32:39Z,I miss the feeling of the vibrating click. Felt like a congratulatory fist bump on my finger
2025-02-19T19:35:11Z,It was so satisfying with Apple Pay.
2025-02-19T21:17:12Z,"I don‚Äôt remember this i went from 6 to X ha. Was that on 7,8 and 11?"
2025-02-19T21:18:21Z,"7, 8, and the 2 recent SEs. Basically anything with a home button past 6S"
2025-02-20T04:47:22Z,Turn on keyboard clicks. Both the sound and the haptics. You‚Äôre welcome.
2025-02-19T16:18:39Z,"From the article: The new iPhone 16e [unveiled](https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/19/apple-announces-iphone-16e/) today features Face ID instead of Touch ID. As a result, Apple no longer sells any new iPhone models with a Home button, for the first time since the original iPhone launched all the way back in 2007.

After debuting in 2007, the Home button gained Touch ID fingerprint authentication when the iPhone 5s launched in 2012. Apple began phasing out the Home button when Face ID debuted on the iPhone X in 2017, and now that the previous iPhone SE with a Home button is discontinued, that process is now complete.

Touch ID is no longer available on any current iPhone models as of today, but it remains built into the power button on the latest iPad Air, iPad mini, and entry-level iPad models. Touch ID also remains a feature on the MacBook Pro and MacBook Air."
2025-02-19T18:54:20Z,TouchID and 5s launched on 2013. 5 launched in 2012
2025-02-20T01:00:16Z,End of a era seriously üòî iPhone SE3 is the last one and will in a couple of years no longer be supported and would be the last of iPhone with home buttons still supported
2025-02-20T10:19:45Z,"A lot of responses here downplaying this, but unlike most of the other inane bits of trivia about the 16e this is actually significant. Apple introduced the Home button on the original iPhone and it‚Äôs taken a further 18 years for it to completely be removed from the product line. Pretty good run to be honest. ¬†"
2025-02-19T16:48:49Z,"Me on my SE 2020, my first phone and iPhone bought by saving up from meagre salary. This October it‚Äôs gonna be 5 years, somehow small form factor is what I clicked with."
2025-02-19T17:26:01Z,"Same boat as you, love the SE. fits in one hand, fits anywhere. Super powerful enough to run future iOS, great camera &amp; excellent durability"
2025-02-19T17:28:21Z,Absolutely agree with you. Phones with smaller screen sizes are an outcast thing now. Yes 18.3 makes my phone just as new as I had unboxed it back then. I‚Äôm really happy with it now.
2025-02-19T18:48:49Z,I think it's accessible.
2025-02-19T21:45:38Z,This is my 2nd phone but I still love it. It is starting to show its age though. I was hoping for a cheaper replacement honestly.
2025-02-19T16:45:37Z,I remember the days where I would turn on the assistive touch just to preserve the home button
2025-02-20T09:41:29Z,Holy crap I thought I was the only one. Hell yeah
2025-02-20T03:05:56Z,Well time to buy all remaining iPhone SE 3s from the Apple Store
2025-02-19T16:26:24Z,But it still sells iPhones without MagSafe (!)
2025-02-19T17:59:04Z,"The Venn diagram of:

- People who know what MagSafe even is

- Customers who will buy 16e

‚Ä¶is two separate circles. It doesn't matter. Like, at all."
2025-02-19T18:37:21Z,"Even I as a Pro user really don‚Äôt use MagSafe. Cables are more efficient and charge faster, and things like my car have standardised Qi charging, not MagSafe."
2025-02-19T20:59:30Z,"I work in a kitchen, and apparently that‚Äôs hard on a lightning port. Around year three, they seize to function, leaving me with wireless as my only way to charge the phone. 

I appreciate MagSafe a lot."
2025-02-19T21:07:26Z,"Lightning ports are very prone to collect dust due to the solid shape of the plug, which makes them lose connectivity eventually. Simply cleaning out the port with a small toothpick should be enough to make it work again.

It also should no longer be an issue, as Lightning is no longer used."
2025-02-20T08:20:47Z,"I hope USB-C can last a bit better. 

I‚Äôve tried many times to pick stuff out, doesn‚Äôt work anymore. 

MagSafe has still been a savior for me, so I sure wouldn‚Äôt be without it. It‚Äôs nice to have that backup."
2025-02-20T23:21:58Z,Agree. I don‚Äôt really see the value in spending more than 10% of my phone‚Äôs purchase price on MagSafe accessories.
2025-02-19T16:34:09Z,what's the deal with magsafe? does it work effectively with a case on?
2025-02-19T16:35:18Z,Of course. Most cases are MagSafe.
2025-02-19T16:49:09Z,"and if you get a case with magsafe, then the 16e has magsafe.

lack of magsafe in the phone itself is an issue for caseless edge-livers only"
2025-02-19T19:47:28Z,"That does up the price of the case though and limit your options. It's the same BS Samsung is pulling with Qi2. ""Well it works with Qi2 no problem. As long as you bought the right case"""
2025-02-19T19:52:19Z,"if you want to use magsafe, your case options are limited anyway.

my 14 pro max has magsafe. the magsafe does not work through my otterbox case. wireless charging itself barely works. I have to take the case off.

only the thinnest of thin barely protective cases allow the magnets to still work through the case"
2025-02-20T01:24:06Z,"That's why you have to look for Magsafe cases. they have magnets in the case as well. Otterbox makes them in most flavors. 

https://www.otterbox.com/en-us/magsafe-iphone-14-pro-max-case-with-magsafe-black/77-89127.html"
2025-02-19T19:48:01Z,"Is that true? Doesn‚Äôt MagSafe allow your phone to ‚Äúknow‚Äù when a device is attached? Like when you attach a MagSafe wallet onto a MagSafe phone, your phone pops up with a dialog saying MagSafe wallet attached or something. I would assume if you just have a magnet case, that software connection doesn‚Äôt happen"
2025-02-19T19:54:50Z,"I don't know about the software side of magsafe. I don't really know what the use case would even be other than it telling you something is connected.

a magsafe case would just allow the wireless charging to pass through the case and mount as a magnet"
2025-02-19T19:56:47Z,"I think there was utility there back for the apple MagSafe charging packs. You could reverse charge the pack from your phone to share battery with someone else. 

Aside from that though yeah, I‚Äôm not sure what else the purpose of the software connections are.  

I basically use MagSafe to mount to my car mount without needing a metal plate like you used to need"
2025-02-19T21:19:56Z,The first part Apple cases don‚Äôt appear to support MagSafe attach lol
2025-02-20T01:21:10Z,"Except Magsafe is 15w, and supports functions like Find My for your wallet. This just has regular 7.5w Qi charging."
2025-02-19T19:44:31Z,Yeah but charging speeds won't be 25w.
2025-02-19T21:13:28Z,In a few years: ‚ÄúApple no longer sells any iPhones with a screen‚Äù
2025-02-19T18:01:12Z,"As someone who rides a two-wheeled vehicle and wears a full-face helmet, I really miss Touch ID T_T"
2025-02-19T17:39:11Z,Does FaceID work in the dark?
2025-02-19T18:22:47Z,Yes
2025-02-19T19:49:41Z,"Yep, FaceID uses IR to map your face. Companies like Google and Samsung have face unlock but it uses the front camera so it needs lots of light to see your face."
2025-02-19T17:51:26Z,yep. It has IR illuminators or something. Dot projection? There's a cool video out there showing how it works.
2025-02-19T19:24:18Z,I miss touchid. Swiping for everything is obnoxious. And I wear a retainer in bed so faceid doesn‚Äôt work when I‚Äôm doomscrolling in bed.
2025-02-19T19:52:18Z,"I wear a CPAP and they have an option in FaceID settings to alternative/masked versions. So you just map your face with your retainer on and it should work. It's rare for mine to fail. 

FaceID is also better for older people who don't have as pronounced fingerprints so fingerprint readers can start to fail for them often."
2025-02-19T20:38:14Z,"Thanks for the suggestion, unfortunately I tried that and no dice. Not sure why mine doesn‚Äôt work but for whatever reason it just doesn‚Äôt.

FaceID works for some folks, TouchID works for others. In the perfect world I‚Äôd have both options and would *gladly* pay for it."
2025-02-19T20:42:58Z,"I prefer TouchID because ADHD and frequently go to unlock my phone, open a protected app and then look away before returning. 

Also it's nice to unlock my phone when it's in carplay without having to pull it up in my field of vision. TouchID is way better imo."
2025-02-20T01:26:52Z,This is the post that made me unsubscribe from this sub. This is how boring Apple headlines have become.
2025-02-19T16:47:18Z,Almost 8 years after the X came out. Wish we had a on screen fingerprint scanner though.
2025-02-20T04:33:49Z,üò•
2025-02-20T06:12:17Z,"I am sad about it though

Why nobody make smart phones for the 10% of us that want this?"
2025-02-21T02:29:00Z,Good. Time to move on
2025-02-19T16:58:53Z,"5 inches isn‚Äôt small, it‚Äôs average!"
2025-02-19T17:06:35Z,"It‚Äôs also not about the screen size, it‚Äôs about how you utilize it."
2025-02-19T18:59:44Z,It gets bigger once you put a case on it.
2025-02-19T22:00:42Z,"But it just doesn‚Äôt feel right, need that raw feeling."
2025-02-21T05:31:10Z,It doesn‚Äôt last long too
2025-02-20T13:41:00Z,You‚Äôre holding it wrong.
2025-02-19T18:33:35Z,IT WAS IN THE POOL!
2025-02-20T14:20:12Z,Above average even. Any bigger than that and it just hurts
2025-02-19T20:33:18Z,How do women know about shrinkage??
2025-02-19T21:38:59Z,It shrinks?
2025-02-19T17:48:29Z,Mini Owners üò¢
2025-02-20T02:44:46Z,Refuse to buy another phone till they do
2025-02-20T04:41:42Z,"At this point, man, we wouldn‚Äôt be buying another phone till eternity. Android doesn‚Äôt have good and small phones either."
2025-02-20T13:30:26Z,"This. Like OnePlus is rumored to drop a ""mini"" phone soon.¬†Mini meaning 6.1"" lmao"
2025-02-21T10:58:54Z,"not even, it‚Äôs 6.3"
2025-02-20T08:10:31Z,"Yeap closest thing to a small phone be flip phones, but you sacrifice in terms of thickness. Small phones are a dying breed."
2025-02-20T06:23:50Z,Likewise
2025-02-21T01:21:26Z,I‚Äôm sticking with my 13 mini until it dies both for the SIM card and the size.
2025-02-20T01:06:19Z,Myself included
2025-02-19T18:20:11Z,"These days a non-max iPhone is considered a small phone, most of the flagship androids are 6.7‚Äù++"
2025-02-20T01:20:45Z,"Remember when they were called ""phablets"" and were considered egregiously large?  That's the standard size now."
2025-02-20T07:37:06Z,"Yeah the Samsung note time, now a Samsung note sized phone is the normal size."
2025-02-21T08:11:19Z,The difference is that the first large-screen phones still had huge bezels on top of the large screens.
2025-02-19T22:11:38Z,"Galaxy S25 is quite small, very nice tbh"
2025-02-20T01:52:00Z,"I own S25. It's 0.6mm smaller than iPhone 16 in three dimensions, but not quite small."
2025-02-19T21:28:39Z,"Yeah, fuck they trend. I want a phone I can use single handed and I‚Äôm a small person, so I‚Äôm switching from my 13 mini"
2025-02-19T17:52:09Z,I will stay with my 13 mini until it doesn‚Äôt get iOS any more. Best iPhone.
2025-02-20T00:04:11Z,My launch day iPhone 13 mini is at 83% battery health. I will replace the battery when it goes below 80% and keep using it for years to come.
2025-02-19T17:55:54Z,I like mine a lot too! The only downside is the battery life.
2025-02-20T00:38:17Z,Cries in iPhone 12 mini (worse battery than 13 mini but still love the phone)
2025-02-19T22:08:51Z,Man I miss my 12 mini. One of my favorite phones ever. Ofc the battery was even worse than the 13 from what I understood haha
2025-02-19T22:38:23Z,The battery is atrocious but I can‚Äôt see myself with a big phone.
2025-02-19T23:07:56Z,"Remember when phones in the 5‚Äù to 5.5‚Äù range were called ‚Äúphablets?‚Äù Pepperidge Farm remembers.

If I‚Äôm Apple, I‚Äôd release a Mini-sized phone once every 3 years. You‚Äôd ensure all the small-phone users are locked in for the long haul. Even if it‚Äôs 5% of the market that prefers a small size, that‚Äôs still a lot of phones."
2025-02-19T20:44:08Z,13 mini was the goat
2025-02-20T01:24:42Z,Is*
2025-02-19T23:31:26Z,I still use my 12 mini and it works like the day I got it. Apple replaced the battery for cheap and can see myself getting another 3 years out of it at least.
2025-02-20T08:33:42Z,"I wish they would keep making mini models.. a lot of us folks like them! I never wanted a giant brick in my pocket. Make an iPhone pro mini please, thanks."
2025-02-19T18:18:11Z,I continue to use my iPhone 12 Mini because I don't want a bigger phone.
2025-02-19T17:36:05Z,"I switched from Android to iPhone because of the smaller 12 mini. I hoped to upgrade to the new SE. 

For now I still wait I guess‚Ä¶but seems like I just have to get used to the idea of a bigger phone."
2025-02-19T22:38:36Z,"Some of those folding Android phones look tempting: smaller screen on the outside for quick stuff, miniature tablet on the inside for extended entertainment and light work."
2025-02-19T22:05:32Z,"I switched from android to a 12 mini as well, as all the decent regular sized phones with android had disappeared and Apple was the only one still selling them. Now that apple doesn't make normal sized phones either I went back to android"
2025-02-19T17:01:10Z,"&gt;With the discontinuation of the iPhone SE today, Apple no longer sells any ""small screen"" smartphones.

&gt;The smallest iPhone Apple now sells is 6.1-inches, with the iPhone 15, iPhone 16e, and iPhone 16 all coming in this display size. The iPhone 16 Pro has a 6.3-inch display, the ‚ÄåiPhone 15‚Äå Plus and ‚ÄåiPhone 16‚Äå Plus are available with 6.7-inch displays, and the ‚ÄåiPhone 16 Pro‚Äå Max features a 6.9-inch display.

&gt;All of the discontinued ‚ÄåiPhone‚Äå display sizes with the device that introduced them are listed below:

&gt; ‚Ä¢ 3.5-inches: ‚ÄåiPhone‚Äå (first-generation, 2007)

&gt; ‚Ä¢ 4-inches: ‚ÄåiPhone‚Äå 5 (2012)

&gt; ‚Ä¢ 4.7-inches: ‚ÄåiPhone‚Äå 6 (2014)

&gt; ‚Ä¢ 5.5-inches: ‚ÄåiPhone‚Äå 6 Plus (2014)

&gt; ‚Ä¢ 5.8-inches: ‚ÄåiPhone‚Äå X (2017)

&gt; ‚Ä¢ 5.4-inches: iPhone 12 mini (2020)

&gt;With no iPhones left on sale with a display smaller than 6-inches and no rumors about any smaller devices in the pipeline, Apple seems to have abandoned the small-screen smartphone market entirely."
2025-02-19T17:24:32Z,"The sad thing is that a ~6 inch screen is small these days. If you shop around, you'll notice that the iPhone, Galaxy S series, and Pixel are the only phone brands that still have an option with a ~6 inch screen. Pretty much everything else has a larger screen."
2025-02-21T03:12:27Z,"You lost me at including 6 plus, doesn‚Äôt matter screen size, that phone was a surfboard. I owned one briefly when it came out."
2025-02-19T20:13:53Z,small screen ‚â† small phone
2025-02-19T23:16:13Z,13 mini here. it‚Äôs the perfect size.
2025-02-20T08:18:53Z,It really is I love it so much
2025-02-19T20:12:08Z,Approaching 4 years with my iPhone 12 mini and still happy with it. Will most likely bring into Apple soon for a battery replacement
2025-02-19T21:26:52Z,"A 5 year upgrade cycle would be fine for the minis. Make a 17 mini, give everyone a chance to upgrade. Then the next upgrade due is the 22. Every few years Apple can spend the R&amp;D to get a surge of panic buyers. And boom- mini market is half catered."
2025-02-19T18:31:23Z,A naked iPhone 12 mini was the greatest feeling iPhone in the hand
2025-02-19T20:44:43Z,For real
2025-02-20T10:44:03Z,"Still rocking it :D

Had my battery replaced in the fall of 2024. Unfortunately the phone still doesn't last long anymore :/ Feels like it gets rather warm all the time. Does anyone have any ideas?"
2025-02-19T17:09:16Z,Loved my minis. Big phones are so dumb.
2025-02-19T22:31:40Z,My wife just got the battery on her 13 Mini replaced. She‚Äôs going to hang onto that thing for as long as possible!
2025-02-20T07:50:28Z,"We still have a super long way to go until obsolescence too! The XS series still received iOS 18 meaning if 6 major updates is the new lifespan, the 13 series will still get iOS 21 lol"
2025-02-19T18:15:24Z,My upgrade cycle missed both the minis. I really wish they would have given that size a few more iterations and proper treatment with a bigger battery.
2025-02-19T18:57:39Z,Me too...but I got the 13 mini anyway (instead of the 14). Let's see how long it lasts.
2025-02-19T20:33:31Z,Looks like me and my SE will grow old together after all.
2025-02-19T16:59:08Z,Well the market has pretty well shown people don‚Äôt want smaller phones. The mini showed that.
2025-02-19T19:05:32Z,"The vocal minority who like the smaller phones don't want to hear it, but it's true. Apple would still be making smaller phones if people wanted them."
2025-02-19T20:00:42Z,"What I don‚Äôt get is people who want a mini shitting on the idea of the air. 

I had a 12 mini but the battery (even with my low usage) was awful, the air looks like it might be the perfect compromise for me"
2025-02-19T19:50:36Z,This. Reddit users forget they represent less than 1% of the population. So when they post here they want something or have technical issues etc it generally means nothing.
2025-02-19T21:54:03Z,Reddit is the only place where people had small phones.  Going back years I‚Äôve had so many friends with iPhones but none of the small ones.    I don‚Äôt know why but they all seem to come to this sub lol
2025-02-19T23:08:39Z,"We are also more likely to keep our phones longer since we aren‚Äôt power-users, so we are a niche market who hang on as long as possible. I‚Äôve only bought two mini phones in like the last decade+."
2025-02-19T17:08:33Z,"I still have the 13 mini, purely because I want a smaller phone."
2025-02-19T17:12:08Z,My wife still has the 12 mini I believe. Not sure what she‚Äôs gonna do when she needs to upgrade because she HATES large phones.
2025-02-19T19:42:59Z,"Hopefully Apple will have a usable foldable phone.

Edit: Obviously doesn‚Äôt help if you like the small form factor for actually using the phone."
2025-02-19T17:33:23Z,"Yep, replaced my battery recently, I‚Äôm gonna hold on to this thing for years purely out of spite"
2025-02-19T17:12:50Z,I might have considered it if the reported battery life wasn‚Äôt so bad
2025-02-20T04:18:45Z,"The reports were overblown, I have no trouble making it through the day on my 13 mini. Sure, a bigger phone might have more capacity but I‚Äôm not so obsessed with a phone that I burn through a battery during the day."
2025-02-19T20:42:45Z,"Gee, small phone means small battery which means small battery life. Who would‚Äôve known!"
2025-02-19T20:18:46Z,I feel like part of that is because the mini has always been a stripped down version of the phone. I wonder how well they‚Äôd sell if they made a 16 mini and a 16 mini pro that had the same features the 16 and 16 pro have‚Ä¶ I really liked the size of the mini but opted to upgrade my 13 mini to the 15 pro last year because I wanted the upgraded capabilities more than I wanted to keep a smaller phone.
2025-02-19T22:14:49Z,"&gt; I feel like part of that is because the mini has always been a stripped down version of the phone.

The Mini had all of the features of the normal sized iPhone of its release year"
2025-02-20T04:19:33Z,"The mini just had a smaller form-factor, it was generally just as capable as the regular."
2025-02-19T19:30:03Z,Not upgrading my 13 Mini. Nothing they offer is better in my opinion in any way- and I used to upgrade every cycle.
2025-02-19T18:28:29Z,"Footprint wise, the 15 Pro is still the smallest recent iPhone, being slightly shorter and narrower than the 16e. 

Considering the 16e $599 starting price, if I do have to replace my 13 Mini, I‚Äôd find a used or leftover stock 15Pro, until Apple make a flip iPhone."
2025-02-19T20:25:33Z,This is sad üòû
2025-02-20T08:54:14Z,"So did ASUS :( There are no good &lt; 6"" phones anymore."
2025-02-20T12:04:17Z,Love my iPhone 12 mini. Pocket size for a trip out. No numb finger from prolonged usage.
2025-02-19T18:05:51Z,"Doesn‚Äôt make any sense, the name it‚Äôs that‚Äôs it‚Äôs 16e (six teeny)"
2025-02-19T17:33:37Z,"Damn, I‚Äôll be really sad when my 12 mini dies üòû"
2025-02-19T21:28:25Z,Good news...you can upgrade to a 13 mini for cheap.  The battery on the mini is better also
2025-02-19T23:14:07Z,"Yeah sure but I would also like to have recent versions, the 13 is going to be too old at some point. I‚Äôm planning to keep this 12 for as long as I can and I can see myself upgrading to a 13 if this 12 dies in 1-2 year"
2025-02-19T17:51:20Z,"As a dev I have to selfishly say this makes my life a bit easier, though I enjoyed having my mini a while back. 

One of the perks of being an iOS dev is having a defined set of device sizes for mobile rather than the wild west with android and mobile web"
2025-02-19T19:35:19Z,eh half the apps I use clearly ignore the 12 mini size anyway ‚Ä¶ more and more apps &amp; websites are janky on mine now
2025-02-19T17:08:46Z,no more announcement of new ipad and mac and airtags???
2025-02-19T17:16:08Z,Nope
2025-02-19T17:31:32Z,it hasn‚Äôt been news for years that they spread out announcements. ipad and mac will have press releases on separate dates
2025-02-19T21:04:46Z,The market doesn‚Äôt want small phones
2025-02-19T17:14:34Z,"This is the real headline. I was really hoping the mini form factor would live on as a SE. I‚Äôll still probably get a 16e, but I‚Äôm pretty bummed."
2025-02-20T05:09:07Z,iPhone 13 mini still hanging in there for me ‚Ä¶
2025-02-19T18:33:38Z,"And later this year the base 17 will be 6.3‚Äù

üò¢"
2025-02-19T17:34:42Z,"So disappointing! I waited impatiently for the last week after my 12mini finally decided I dropped it too many times and got a shiny new bright pixel line down the screen‚Ä¶I saw the rumours but was hanging on to a teeny tiny amount of hope. Taking it in this weekend, they still have repair pricing online so fingers crossed they can still do it!"
2025-02-19T18:29:25Z,Larger phones are more awkward. I would much rather the watch have a direct connection to the iPad.
2025-02-20T01:47:54Z,That sucks. I‚Äôm a SE user and I dislike the larger phones. Might be a big enough deal breaker for me to move away from Apple next time I need to replace my phone.
2025-02-20T13:02:04Z,But to what? There‚Äôs really no small phones that are compelling. I‚Äôve toyed around with the CAT flip phone but I really don‚Äôt want an Android.¬†
2025-02-19T20:43:52Z,"No one‚Äôs surprised. Small phones don‚Äôt sell, despite what the vocal minority tells you. The sales of the mini were terrible."
2025-02-19T17:55:18Z,"I loved my 12 Mini. I really debated between the 13 Mini and the 14 Pro Max and ultimately went for the 14 Pro Max for battery life. Now I'm on the 16 Pro Max. The screen size is great, but I still wish for a modern mini sometimes."
2025-02-19T19:46:19Z,I think the 6.1 iPhone 16e is above average. In fact too large lol
2025-02-19T16:34:02Z,"&gt;After introducing the iPhone 16e today, Apple has discontinued the third-generation iPhone SE.

&gt;As a result of the iPhone SE being discontinued, several individual iPhone features have also met the end of the road. Apple no longer sells any iPhone models with a a Home button, Touch ID, LCD screen, a sub-6-inch screen size, or Lightning.

&gt;Apple also discontinued the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus today.

&gt;The lineup now consists of the iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16 Pro, iPhone 16 Pro Max, iPhone 16e, iPhone 15, and iPhone 15 Plus.

&gt;There is a bit of a quirk in Apple's current iPhone lineup. The iPhone 16e has an outdated notch, yet it has Apple's latest A18 chip and Apple Intelligence support. Meanwhile, the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus have the newer Dynamic Island, yet a two-generations-old A16 Bionic chip and no Apple Intelligence support.

&gt;Apple will likely discontinue the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus when the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Air, and iPhone 17 Pro models launch in September."

2025-02-19T16:50:29Z,Yes. Same here too. Been rocking my SE 2020 for 4 plus years now
2025-02-19T17:44:58Z,"Same.  I was thinking about an update soon but that $599 price point for the base model is a pretty hard sell, especially when the consensus seemed to be $499."
2025-02-20T00:27:51Z,Yup.  $499 would have been rough but somewhat in line with SE pricing.  $599 is horse shit.  If it had ProMotion it could be justified but at $600 you‚Äôre better off getting an older Pro model or paying up for the regular lineup.  This is a rare Apple fail.
2025-02-21T10:43:37Z,"...fail? If you're paying up for the regular lineup, it's a win for them."
2025-02-19T19:42:20Z,"*$599?* The 16e has a ~$1000 price point in Canada, which is so wildly unfair. Conversion rate would have it at $850."
2025-02-21T10:45:47Z,It's 730‚Ç¨ here in Europe... For the base 128 GB model...
2025-02-21T15:24:56Z,730‚Ç¨ is $1080CAD... or $760USD. That's so stupid.
2025-02-20T00:25:34Z,Yes $599.  Why would anyone qualify the standard USD price for every other country?
2025-02-20T23:52:25Z,"Because $599USD is $850CAD. The phone is selling in Canada (and Mexico) for $700USD, that's an extra 100USD. Which sucks. That's all.

Edit: It would be cheaper for me to buy it in the states and have it shipped. Which again, sucks."
2025-02-20T23:57:02Z,Is your reading comprehension this bad typically?
2025-02-19T17:51:42Z,"Consensus seemed to be for 64 gb model, not 128 gb model. Which lines up with some of the leaks if you think about it"

2025-02-19T16:45:24Z,"So presumably, instead of a separate line entirely- what we‚Äôre getting for the affordable end is an ‚Äúe‚Äù model addition every few phone generations?

Guessing it‚Äôs likely too soon to get a 17e.

Maybe an 18e or 19e?"
2025-02-19T19:38:44Z,"The SE and now just ‚ÄòE‚Äô models appear to be the ‚Äòaffordable‚Äô model, but they are primarily enterprise phones designed for large scale MDM deployment.

2025-02-20T01:12:16Z,"$599 also happens to be ideal pricing for being the ""Free Phone"" you get from a carrier without a trade-in."

Even while a bizarre combo of features, I still might go for this when I retire my 13pro."

2025-02-19T17:03:11Z,"That‚Äôs what I mean, if we‚Äôre getting a 16e as of right now but losing the SE line - for future models are we getting _e with every upgrade or is it once every few jumps. I was leaning towards the latter since with this happening now I can‚Äôt imagine them debuting a 17e as they didn‚Äôt regularly refresh SE models (it capped at 3 generations)."

2025-02-20T14:58:23Z,You should be able to get service on Apple devices for at least five years after they are removed from sale on the market. Sometimes up to seven years.
2025-02-21T05:42:40Z,Damn it‚Äôs gonna be repairable until March 2030 then. That‚Äôs a long time for home button repairs. LOL That‚Äôll be when Touch ID finally is over on the home button. Apple does 5 years since my XS Max literally got the boot November of last year and they stopped sales September 2019. That‚Äôs 5 years and two months basically.

2025-02-20T03:39:25Z,Apple discontinues budget phones :(. That's what it actually means.
2025-02-20T08:45:20Z,"They‚Äôve never made ‚Äúbudget‚Äù ones, in the first place."
2025-02-20T23:05:56Z,"The SE 1 was pretty affordable (initially $400, a year later it went down $350 and then $249 a year after that). It was also supported for a long time. I got my first one in 2017 at the Apple store for $400 (32GB model) and it lasted me 4 years. Then I got a used (renewed) 64GB SE 1 for $125 and I'm still using it."
2025-02-21T01:50:05Z,"The $399 in 2016 money translates to $528.11 in 2025, for a 16GB model.

I wouldn't call only a $70 difference ""affordable,"" exactly.

Edit

If you argue that the lowest tier has effectively been gotten rid of, we're talking $660.47, so the 16e is actually cheaper..."
2025-02-21T04:24:00Z,"By the time I bought it (mid 2017), it was the equivalent of $518 today and I got the 32GB MODEL, not the 16GB. Also, when it first came out, its features were much closer to a flagship phone than the 16e is now (it was essentially a smaller 6S - the latest and most advanced phone Apple was selling at the time). Even when I bought it (after the iPhone 7 came out), it was still near flagship level. That's not the case with the 16e. The 15 Pro is significantly better and more advanced. The 15e is basically the equivalent of getting a 6 back then (not 6S or SE). It lacks basic features that iPhones have had for years.

I'm not sure how the $400 ($518 in today's dollars) that I paid for my 32GB SE gets you to $660.47. Even $600 is too high for the 16e (not a budget phone). In my opinion dropping the price down to $500 + adding in the missing features would have made it a budget phone (and refurbished would have been under $450). For the current model, it should be $450 (and yes, I do consider that a budget option, but since it costs $150 more, its not a budget option)."
2025-02-21T05:54:55Z,"&gt; By the time I bought it (mid 2017), it was the equivalent of $518 today

Irrelevant. This phone just came out, we're comparing launch prices.

&gt;its features were much closer to a flagship phone than the 16e is now

LOL, they really were not. It was the same, generation old design, with then current guts. Exactly the same.

&gt;The 15 Pro is significantly better and more advanced

15 Pro is no longer on sale. Pointless comparison. And no, it's not.

&gt;I'm not sure how the $400 ($518 in today's dollars) that I paid for my 32GB SE gets you to $660.47

Because the lowest tier was discontinued and the 16e is taking place of the one step up one, therefore we're comparing it to the $499 one, not the cheapest one. 

Actually, we're comparing it to the $479 SE3, which actually makes your comparison to the 1st one even worse, because it was literally the *most* expensive one, out of the four.

&gt;dropping the price down to $500 + adding in the missing features would have made it a budget phone

Yes, that makes total sense. That device already exists, it's called iPhone 16 and costs several hundred dollars more. Are you slow?

&gt;I do consider that a budget option

No you don't! You're literally arguing that a $660 phone was a budget option!"
2025-02-20T14:57:55Z,I like the SE name as it makes me think of the Macintosh SE
2025-02-19T22:48:52Z,"An article I wrote a month ago on why the original SE was the best phone Apple ever made (my own site, I don't run any ads or analytics)

https://blog.bschwind.com/2025/01/11/the-original-iphone-se-is-the-best-iphone-apple-ever-made/"
2025-02-19T18:36:28Z,I suppose they kinda had to with the price the 16e is landing at.
2025-02-20T00:50:40Z,"It is arguably worse than the 14. It has a marginally faster SoC, a marginally better main camera sensor, and a marginally longer battery life (TBC IRL). Otherwise, it‚Äôs got worse 5G, no MagSafe, no UWB chip (no precise locating of AirTags), no ultrawide camera, no cinematic mode, no action mode, and fewer colour options. Retailing for the same amount the 14 did yesterday. Unless you must have the half baked mess that Apple Intelligence is, it is too expensive for what it is.

Ah, and no sensor shift stabilisation, which we had since the 13 vanilla. Basically worse low light performance than the 14."
2025-02-20T04:40:52Z,The camera quality is still up in the air because the 16e uses a smaller 1/2.55‚Äù sensor with 0.7um pitch at 48MP without 100% Focus Pixels (I assume they use the 16 Pro UW sensor because the specifications matched) while the 14 has 35% larger 1/1.65‚Äù sensor with 1.9um pitch and 100% Focus Pixels and sensor-shift stabilization.
2025-02-20T08:47:46Z,"Any source for that? If true, it is indeed very disappointing, but not all that surprising, sadly. Also, the sensor size gap would be 1.9/(2*0.7) squared, because the binned pixels (1.4 um per 4-pixel cluster equivalent) are smaller on both the X axis and the Y axis. So you basically get an 84% larger sensor on the iPhone 14. The new sensor size would be on par with the iPhone 11/12 sensor size, with even the iPhone 13 having a 47% larger sensor. The rumoured Pixel 9a is also expected to have a 40% larger sensor than the 16E in that case."
2025-02-20T09:37:59Z,"[https://imgur.com/a/oRfyM5H](https://imgur.com/a/oRfyM5H)

The 16e reuses the iPhone 14‚Äôs chassis, from the official video it looks like Apple only made minimal changes (screw holes). You can cross reference the relative position of the unchanged screw holes to find the approximate locations of the components in the new 16e. The camera module‚Äôs size supports the smaller sensor. Also, iPhone 16e camera has ‚ÄúHybrid Focus Pixels‚Äù instead of ‚Äú100% Focus Pixels‚Äù on the main camera since iPhone 11. The only camera that has ‚ÄúHybrid Focus Pixels‚Äù is the UW on the 16 Pro (you can check this in the tech specs on Apple‚Äôs website)"
2025-02-20T10:46:05Z,"Thanks! So it‚Äôs a worse camera than any of the iPhones released since 2019, minus the SEs."
2025-02-21T05:20:28Z,They kinda had to due to USB C restrictions in some locations.
2025-02-19T22:44:31Z,14 pro still better though?
2025-02-20T00:48:02Z,"Depends entirely what your priorities are. 

For me personally any phone prior to the iPhone 15 is a non starter purely for usb-c"
2025-02-19T22:50:15Z,14 pro hasn‚Äôt been sold by Apple since the 15 came out
2025-02-19T18:48:19Z,"I guess they decided to discontinue the 14 because in the EU sales of this model is already prohibited due to the lack of the USB-c port. Keeping the model alive with one of the largest pieces of the market gone isn‚Äôt logical. 

The 14 (pro) and SE 2022 were discontinued in the EU on December 27th last year.

Discontinuing sales will most probably not stop iOS support for the model since even Xr (2018) is still getting the latest upgrade. That‚Äôs 4 entire years older!
Agreed, Apple should have decided to cut the Xr from iOS 18 support. The phone just can‚Äôt keep up anymore."
2025-02-20T01:59:07Z,As far as I understand it didn't mean products pre USB C couldn't be sold and would get binned - that would be incredibly wasteful. It's any new tech manufactured after X date needs USB C instead and eventually the pre C tech will phase out naturally
2025-02-20T05:18:03Z,"Apple pulled them both out of the shop on that date. You‚Äôre not telling me that miraculously stock dried for all 4 models and even more variations at the same moment.

Everyone knew it was coming. Apple could have decided to stop restocking. iPhones are considerably more expensive over here, so keeping a lower priced model available has its pros.."
2025-02-21T09:16:51Z,"The law was approved in October 2022, with a 2 year transition period. Old devices on the market can still be sold, but the iPhone 14 devcies sold until recently weren't old stock but nee manufacturing. So Apple could either change manufacturing and use USB-C or stop selling it - they decided to do the latter.¬†


Apple obviously new this was coming, but they pushed it to the limit."
2025-02-20T00:47:38Z,I think a lot of people are forgetting that the iPhone 14 and 14 Plus are both closer to iPhone 13 models.  The SOC is the same as the 13s.  It is really a 3.5 year old phone in disguise.  It probably more about the A15 chip than anything else.  That plus this phone occupies the same price point.  We will see what happens next year.  That will be more telling.
2025-02-20T01:49:51Z,I just got a 14 Plus in December. I love it. It never lags and the battery life is the best of any phone I‚Äôve ever had. I plan on keeping it a while

Motorola is slowly closing the gap in features now as well, with their G power even being IP rated and with eSim support.. things that were a premium previously.  I would have thought that the iPhone SE to kids being the gateway to more expensive models over time was a real thing.. but maybe I am wrong."
2025-02-19T22:37:48Z,Considering the iPhone 14 is 599 and you can get a much better phone (iPhone 16e) for 599 it‚Äôs a no brainer to get rid of this model.

2025-02-19T22:58:08Z,Multiple cameras don‚Äôt matter. The megapixel is higher therefore better resolution. MagSafe isn‚Äôt a break it or make it deal for the price. I doubt the modem will be bad. They obviously QA test this stuff before it‚Äôs released unsure why it‚Äôs ‚Äúunproven‚Äù.

2025-02-20T00:27:34Z,It‚Äôs more the lack of the Se or the 13 below it.. for a long time they have had a $400 ish device.  The SE3 was removed too at $429.
2025-02-19T21:24:34Z,I think it‚Äôs hard to justify manufacturing a phone that can‚Äôt be sold in many major markets (anywhere in Europe due to the lighting port). Apple wants to prioritize products they can sell across the globe.
2025-02-20T04:36:52Z,They could make a cheap iPhone with USB-C if they wanted to
2025-02-20T13:21:25Z,"And name it ""iPhone 16e"" with e for ""economy"" or something. And price it $599, because that's cheap for Apple."
2025-02-20T13:29:30Z,$599 isn‚Äôt cheap
2025-02-20T14:25:35Z,It is. Midrange phones start from $30000000000 get a grip
2025-02-20T19:27:20Z,"The E will be at least ¬£50 off by black friday and ¬£499 in a year or two, this is priced for the long game"
2025-02-20T16:26:29Z,"Don't worry, Google will squander the opportunity and launch the 9a at $600 to match the 16E.¬†"
2025-02-19T17:30:43Z,Apple is just pissing people off at this point. They‚Äôre handing google and android phones business
2025-02-19T20:58:05Z,Lmfao okay calm down
2025-02-19T21:56:35Z,Europe demands USB-C .. apples hands were tied.
2025-02-20T23:02:41Z,This article is only referring to what Apple supply through their own stores and website.  Apple regularly continues to manufacture older models than they range themselves for supply to partner retailers.  You can still buy recently manufactured stock of the iPhone 13 through partner retailers even though it hasn‚Äôt been available directly from Apple since October last year.  iPhone 14 will be no different.
2025-02-20T03:00:53Z,Trash phone anyway. Exact copy of the 13. It was more like a 13s
2025-02-20T19:24:58Z,"They should have just launched a 13 plus and sold all 3, then the pros."
2025-02-19T16:20:30Z,"&gt;Apple has officially discontinued the iPhone 14 and ‚ÄåiPhone 14‚Äå Plus, removing them from its product lineup following the announcement of the iPhone 16e.

&gt;The ‚ÄåiPhone 14‚Äå and ‚ÄåiPhone 14‚Äå Plus were introduced in September 2022 as the standard models in Apple's annual smartphone refresh, positioned below the higher-end Pro models. At the time of their discontinuation, the ‚ÄåiPhone 14‚Äå was priced at $599, while the ‚ÄåiPhone 14‚Äå Plus was available for $699, marking a reduction from their original launch prices of $799 and $899, respectively.

&gt;The standard ‚ÄåiPhone 14‚Äå retained a 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR display, while the ‚ÄåiPhone 14‚Äå Plus introduced a 6.7-inch variant‚Äîthe first time Apple offered a large-screen option on a non-Pro model. Unlike previous years, there was no ‚ÄåiPhone 14‚Äå mini, as Apple opted to replace the compact 5.4-inch model with the larger Plus variant.

&gt;Both devices were powered by the A15 Bionic chip, which had originally debuted in the iPhone 13, featuring a 5-core GPU for improved graphics performance. They also gained Crash Detection, which leveraged onboard sensors to detect severe car accidents and automatically contact emergency services if the user was unresponsive, and Emergency SOS via satellite, allowing users to communicate with emergency responders in areas without cellular or Wi-Fi connectivity.

&gt;The camera system was enhanced with the introduction of the Photonic Engine, a computational photography technology aimed at improving low-light performance across all cameras. Additionally, the front-facing TrueDepth camera received autofocus for the first time to improve sharpness in selfies and video calls.

&gt;It's worth noting Apple has never discontinued a mainline ‚ÄåiPhone‚Äå midway through the year before. With their removal from Apple's website, the company's non-Pro lineup now consists of only the ‚ÄåiPhone 16e‚Äå, iPhone 15 and ‚ÄåiPhone 15‚Äå Plus, and iPhone 16 and ‚ÄåiPhone 16‚Äå Plus."
2025-02-21T05:41:00Z,Tim cook only knows profit. The new iPhones are so confusing man
2025-02-23T00:06:01Z,Maybe because the 14 is a better phone than the 16e
2025-02-19T16:20:02Z,So how is it you could buy an iphone 12 when i got my 15 a few months ago?
2025-02-19T17:32:08Z,Carrier old stock.

2025-02-20T00:27:19Z,It‚Äôs funny when deluded Apple haters act like iOS‚Äôs RAM efficiency is a flaw. I hold the controversial opinion that it‚Äôs *good* when smartphones run smoothly with less than 16gb of RAM ü§∑
2025-02-20T01:29:04Z,I‚Äôm not a hater lol. Im typing this from a MacBook Pro that i had to pay $2200 for in order to not be stuck with 8gb.
2025-02-19T17:04:13Z,Let‚Äôs hope my iPhone 2022 last long and Apple realise than not everybody likes an iPad mini in their pocket.
2025-02-19T17:54:15Z,"It JUST came out, is Apple serious??"
2025-02-19T18:09:57Z,"I mean, they can‚Äôt sell the 14 in Europe at all since it has lightning. No point in continuing to produce that phone. I‚Äôm 100% convinced the 16e is a response to that."
2025-02-19T18:37:38Z,"Yeah, it doesn't really make sense to produce an iPhone that's literally banned in a huge market."
2025-02-19T21:56:02Z,The 14 is 2 years old bro.
2025-02-19T21:56:40Z,That's fairly newüò≠
2025-02-20T00:29:20Z,Can you name even one other smartphone manufacturer still producing models that are over two years old?
2025-02-20T00:51:58Z,Doubt he could even name a smartphone manufacturer that wasn‚Äôt Samsung or Google.
2025-02-19T23:38:01Z,Get with the times; anything over 1 year is old these days

2025-02-20T15:55:37Z,"Is there any reasonable possibility this kind of technology will be available soon or already exists?  
  
On my Mac, I want to have some sort of intelligent digital assistant to help me navigate quicker. I want to be able to say into my microphone connected to my Mac, ""Open the Sunday folder for this week on the server.""

The assistant needs to understand the meaning of this phrase contextually and perform the task.

It would need to know what I mean by ""the sever"". Knowing that this is the phrase I consistently use to refer to my company's backup server we are all connected to, with many terabytes of storage.

It would also need to know what I mean by ""Sunday folder for this week"". On the server we have a section of folders that are all set up for each Sunday of the year. They all start with 2025, then have the month in two digits, then the day in two digits. So Sunday, February 16th's folder would start with 20250216. May 11 would be 20250511.

Therefore, it needs to know I mean, ""In Finder, open a new window for the folder on the server that represents this upcoming Sunday."""
2025-02-20T15:57:24Z,"Yes, of course I can create folder alias shortcuts, use the Go to Folder... feature in Finder, and I also have Keyboard Maestro. But the ideal is to give me the opportunity to not need my hands on the keyboard or mouse."
2025-02-20T16:53:31Z,No. You‚Äôre going to need a future context-sensitive version of Apple Intelligence for that.

Anyone have any advice here considering the servers appear to be working?

2025-02-20T22:04:30Z,I cracked the back of my iPhone 16 pro and sent back my defective cracked device. Today I received a broken iPhone 12 Pro Max and apple said that I sent in the wrong device and are do not believe that I sent in the right device.

2025-02-20T22:50:16Z,"I‚Äôm looking to trade in my Mac Mini and buy a refurbished MacBook Air from Apple, either M2 or M3. I heard the M4 Air is coming very soon. Would it be wiser to wait for the potential price decrease of the M2/M3? On the other hand, it seems like Apple is increasing their pricing, and maybe it‚Äôs possible that they may not decrease the rices at all? Obviously nobody knows what they will do, but would love to hear your thoughts."
2025-02-21T14:50:19Z,"Nobody outside Apple really knows what will happen, and the M3 MacBook Air is a great laptop that will last you a while; it will not be obsoleted by the M4 when it‚Äôs out."

I don‚Äôt understand why Apple doesn‚Äôt just make everything standard.  Should I send it back?  Is the ECG even accurate?

It says the SE can detect irregular heart rhythm.  On tutorials, it suggests you wait for the irregular rhythm, then do the ECG at that point.  Ok, but I could also just go to the Dr and do it once I get the notification.  Is the irregular heart rhythm detection accurate?

Not sure what I should do."
2025-02-21T02:57:41Z,"Hmm, I see, all the versions before series 10 are ‚Äúrenewed‚Äù that I‚Äôm seeing.  So to get ecg on a new model you have to pay 70% more money.  Meh"

2025-02-21T14:47:33Z,"No; if you do a trade-in with Apple, they send you a box at the same time as the new item, and you wipe the device once your data is transferred, and then you put it in the box &amp; ship it back to Apple."

It won't write, I can't use the shortcuts on the pen. To use the pencil again, I must plug out the iPad and wait for 5 minutes or so. Is there any fix to this issue?

I think it's due to heating of the iPad because at the satrt of the day I won't have a problem but after non stop use of 4-4.5 hours this becomes an issue."

2025-02-19T17:10:13Z,"They should, there's no doubt its capable enough. But Apple definitely wants to fence off certain features for new hardware so there is more of an incentive to purchase new devices."
2025-02-19T18:34:58Z,"according to the 16e event footnotes:

*Visual intelligence is available in iOS 18.2 or later on all iPhone 16 models. For more information on visual intelligence, visit support.apple.com/guide/iphone.*

So no, it is still not available on the 15 pro. At least, now we have a ""real"" reason: it's not because of the button, but because of some executive decision."
2025-02-20T10:37:01Z,"Technically the ‚Äúreason‚Äù is that the 15 Pros don‚Äôt have an A18 chip (which is BS, even an A14 chip could handle Visual ‚ÄúIntelligence‚Äù)"
2025-02-19T17:16:40Z,"bruh you dont get it. the action button on the old phones isnt powerful enough to power Visual Intelligence. 

if it was possible, they would have done it. it‚Äôs not like they artificially restrict basic software features to newer models for no reason"
2025-02-23T14:43:35Z,"It was possible, Apple just chose not to. It‚Äôs all marketing. I can accept it only working for the 8GB ram phones, which would include the 15 Pro which also misses this feature but otherwise has Apple Intelligence. 

Just like the Intel Mac‚Äôs not getting 3D maps in Apple Maps, but of course Google Earth does 3D maps on those Mac‚Äôs just fine. It‚Äôs not that the Mac‚Äôs lacked anything, it‚Äôs that Apple wanted feature segmentation."
2025-02-20T13:49:49Z,Capable? Lmao an iPhone 11 could do visual intelligence. It‚Äôs literally just google lens search and chat GPT
2025-02-20T18:59:55Z,"I don‚Äôt think it was ever about that. Any model with OCR capabilities should be enough; I always thought it was more a matter of access. This Visual Intelligence thing is already barely useful, if at all, as it is; I‚Äôd say the only thing it has going on for it is its ease of access. Make it a button in Control Center or bury it somewhere else and I‚Äôd already stop seeing any reason for it to even exist.

They should have made it an option for the Action Button since the very beginning, though, in my opinion; at least better late than never, I guess‚Ä¶"

2025-02-20T15:48:16Z,Also last years phones only had 8GB of RAM so you were wrong about it needing 16. They don‚Äôt even make any iPhones with 16.

2025-02-20T03:12:37Z,I'm about 99% certain Visual Intelligence is just a more live version of Visual Lookup and Live Text that most iOS devices already have.

2025-02-20T22:19:16Z,Yes I think we will get it I say think because I have no proof of this but I saw a Reddit post today where someone contacted the apple support about this and they said yes in a future update

2025-02-19T18:40:09Z,"At least we have USB 3.2 speeds ;)

.. and not 2.0 speeds on a phone launched with USB-C in 2025

(If it were 3.x speeds they would've mentioned it. And while I am aware many people don't use USB that often, as soon as you want to locally back up / transfer photos on a 512GB phone you will change your mind)"
2025-02-20T22:23:06Z,It‚Äôs been confirmed that they get it to
2025-02-19T18:32:52Z,"I wish Visual Intelligence was one of the features that could be turned off separately from other Intelligence features. It‚Äôs not only useless, but it actually removed a useful feature from the camera button."
2025-02-19T18:34:34Z,The useful feature being?
2025-02-19T19:02:16Z,"Press &amp; hold to instantly start recording a video. That gesture now opens Visual Intelligence. 

To start recording a video, you now have to click the button to open the camera app, wait a second, then press &amp; hold to start recording the video. If you don‚Äôt wait that second to press the button again it will take a picture instead of starting a video."
2025-02-19T20:36:23Z,"Oh yeah. Good point. 

the implementation they went with makes sense to me. 

The first click is to just open the app

Your clicks or presses from there are to record or take photos. 

Pressing and holding functions more like the side button for Siri meaning so they conceptually lineup and are easier to internalise

Pressing and holding the way you suggest in practice probably wouldn‚Äôt actually start the recording any faster than click and then a long press. 

In that the app still has to open before you can start recording and for as fast as that is is still takes longer than the brief pause you take between clicking and long pressing 

And it‚Äôs not like there‚Äôs any way to immediately take a photo with a single gesture system wide so it would be kinda weird if there was for video but not for photos."
2025-02-19T21:33:46Z,It was noticeably faster and more convenient to do it in 18.0 and 18.1 before they changed the gesture in 18.2.
2025-02-19T22:52:12Z,Wow I‚Äôve had an iPhone for 15 years and this is the first I‚Äôm hearing about press and hold for video. Thank you!
2025-02-20T16:16:38Z,"They are talking about the new camera button that was added last year. If you press and hold it, it does lookup with Visual Intelligence and they would rather it record."
2025-02-20T03:44:34Z,"An A18 only feature, because it‚Äôs software locked to only work on A18 chips. üò≠

EDIT: Apple announced it‚Äôll come to the 15 Pro series via an update."
2025-02-20T16:34:07Z,Nope. It‚Äôs now stated it will come in an update!
2025-02-20T16:36:20Z,I just saw the new articles about it too!
2025-02-20T09:56:32Z,Is visual intelligence or google image search better?
2025-02-20T18:55:44Z,"Google Search is part of it; it‚Äôs a combination of that, ChatGPT, and Apple‚Äôs own thing for translations, date and phone number detection, Quick Lookup, etc."
2025-02-19T18:50:35Z,"I don‚Äôt understand how this is possible. 

Did they really re-engineer the Action Button hardware just for the iPhone 16e?! 

That‚Äôs crazy! I guess they weren‚Äôt able to get the tech working in time for the 16/16Pro, so they had to split the functionality into a separate button. 

Apple has the best hardware engineering team on the planet!! üí™üçé"
2025-02-19T20:30:40Z,They didn‚Äôt do this for the 16/pro because those devices have a dedicated non customisable button to handle this function.

2025-02-19T17:37:30Z,The SE has never had MagSafe in any of the generations so I'm not sure why we'd expect it here or would be saying no magsafe now like it had it to begin with
2025-02-20T15:49:24Z,"This is a 16 variant, not an SE and it's a weird downgrade considering Apple convinced the Qi consortium to include MagSafe-style connections in Qi2. The SE never had OLED screens, FaceID, or an Action Button either."
2025-02-19T18:46:47Z,"The lack of MagSafe has me worried about the new iPhones this fall. However, it does have a limited wireless charging speed. That gives me hope that the ‚Äúflagship‚Äù iPhones this fall will in fact still be MagSafe compatible‚Ä¶ but Apple does weird stuff sometimes"
2025-02-22T18:31:43Z,There‚Äôs no reason to think Apple will abandon MagSafe in their flagships

2025-02-19T18:34:31Z,"And no fun colors!
They didn‚Äôt even bother adding some colorful touch to this bland model."
2025-02-20T01:40:09Z,Cuz it‚Äôs a budget phone
2025-02-20T07:42:27Z,iPhone 5C disagrees.
2025-02-19T22:55:58Z,"The only thing that really matters from your list is the UWB antenna - MagSafe can be pretty easily corrected for via cases, nobody uses mmWave... it's not even in the pro phones overseas, and isn't HSDPA an older thing?"
2025-02-19T23:50:46Z,[deleted]
2025-02-19T23:54:35Z,"mmWave being in cities doesn't mean jack - it's all over New York but basically requires me to stand at a specific street corner to get any sort of performance near what it promises - it's fine, maybe in a few years it'll be a bigger deal, but it's nowhere near good in its current state...

I mean, do you really actually think people buying this phone care about the intricacies of wireless charging...? I doubt half of them use wireless charging in the first place"
2025-02-20T00:51:05Z,I could see having no mmWave. This is their first C1 chip and it‚Äôs on the SE phone for a reason
2025-02-20T08:28:53Z,"I don't think it's made for you.

I usually get the pro phone, I'm sure lots of people in this sub do. I've never heard of most of the things you mentioned. 

It looks like a completely reasonable budget phone for people who don't care about or know about mmWave or hspda or any of that stuff. I'm not sure why you're acting like this is some affront, when you likely wouldn't even be buying a budget iPhone anyway.."

2025-02-20T11:29:51Z,"Hm, it's not something I pay much mind to, can't remember the last time I had signal issues, it's just not something that occurs to me - but maybe that's because my phone has always had those things haha"
2025-02-20T00:53:53Z,Why does hsdpa matter? I‚Äôm not super knowledgeable on that. Most that I know is that It was used for 3g but we are on 4g and 5g now

2025-02-20T02:41:21Z,Why should all phone support all technologies? That‚Äôs why you have choice.
2025-02-20T15:51:27Z,"Not including MagSafe and UWB which are a big part of Apple's ecosystem is kinda dumb, not including MMwave is to be expected on a lower end phone."
2025-02-20T08:35:20Z,Max price for this garbage should be 300$.¬†
2025-02-23T12:02:23Z,$500 with MagSafe and U1 would have been acceptable. $600 without is an insult.
2025-02-19T16:29:24Z,"They're still expensive though for ""budget"" iPhones. $700 for 256gb version? wtf"
2025-02-19T18:51:02Z,And that 700 for the 256 version will still be cheaper than the 128 version I can get in Europe.
2025-02-19T23:56:14Z,"Right? This thing should be $400 tops, $500 for the 256gb variant with all the gimping. 

Yeah I know apple quality and all that but compared to some good android offerings in that price range, this thing is heavily relying on it just being an iphone."
2025-02-20T04:24:10Z,"I just parted with an S24 that I loved, specifically so that when this SE replacement arrived I would pick it up.

Now don't I feel the fool. That S24 was a really amazing phone, with a great 120 Hz screen, that could be used one handed pretty easily. I picked it up on sale for $799CAD, a hundred bones less than I'd have to pay for this 16e. It's pretty much better in every way than this 16e is, except maybe on the processor."
2025-02-20T13:38:41Z,"Why would you think the new SE, an entry level budget phone, be better than a flagship phone from a year ago?"
2025-02-20T14:57:33Z,"I didn't think the new phone would be better than my S24.

My needs in a phone are modest. I'm perfectly fine trading down on features and quality *if I also trade down on the price*. Apple wants me to trade down on the features and quality but pay more for that privilege.

Who would be OK with that?"
2025-02-20T14:59:35Z,"Yeah, the 16e is about $100 too expensive."
2025-02-19T17:58:06Z,I would love that tiny little camera lens bump. I think this will be more popular than some expect but no MagSafe is a no go from me at this point.
2025-02-19T16:36:38Z,Sidebar: anyone know what Nike shoes Tim Apple is wearing?

2025-02-19T16:39:35Z,"Apple, releases trash budget phones. Also Apple, see the people don‚Äôt want budget phones."

They should have named it the iPhone Air‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.

2025-02-19T17:57:41Z,"&gt; The phone will become dated to the average consumer by September. 

I'm not sure you understand how the average consumer buys phones.

Verizon: We're running a promo, renew for 2 more years and get the new iPhone 16e for free!

Person: Great!

12 and 13's are being offered by prepaid providers though."
2025-02-19T18:57:34Z,What makes you think they will be selling a 5 year old phone
2025-02-20T03:04:55Z,"Also, this is the exact kind of phone business love to give their employees as work phones. ‚ÄúCheap‚Äù and reliable."

2025-02-20T00:30:12Z,Commenting about how much you don‚Äôt care is a commodity.
2025-02-19T18:04:35Z,I had this dream a few days back that I was using an old iphone 8 with dynamic island and thought about it for a whole day
2025-02-19T16:41:26Z,I knew it would be another crappy budget phone and not actually something innovative with AI
2025-02-19T18:00:30Z,Except it‚Äôs not a budget phone‚Ä¶
2025-02-19T18:19:48Z,It's an expensive phone being paraded around as budget. Pretty sure they are ditching the SE as well so it'll be your only option. Better off buying a used iphone 11 honestly
2025-02-20T00:32:40Z,"And if it actually was something innovative with AI you‚Äôd still complain that nobody wants AI. 

There is no pleasing people like you, you enjoy being upset at everything."
2025-02-20T00:17:02Z,"I was going to upgrade but considering the fact that the CEO of Apple gave Trump a million bucks for his slush fund, I‚Äôll look elsewhere"
2025-02-19T17:14:34Z,Apple is becoming like an old mother that still gives birth; all the new babies have some sort of birth defects.
2025-02-19T18:25:32Z,"It's not that hard, apple. Make an iPhone with actual barebones for $300 and people will actually have a budget choice. $500 for a slightly shittier iPhone 16 isn't gonna cut it."
2025-02-19T20:22:13Z,it‚Äôs a dud. for multiple different reasons.
2025-02-19T19:32:46Z,I still have the iphone 7 do i upgrade to this?
2025-02-19T17:54:08Z,I thought the event was at 10 pst
2025-02-19T18:01:47Z,A complete miss by Apple. They even fumbled the chance to name their 10th gen SE phone SE X by changing it to 16e!
2025-02-19T18:18:48Z,What a steaming pile of shit this phone is. Fusion cameras are ass. i had to disable fusion capability on my 16 pro max because it just doesn't work in practice i was always taking blurry photos cause it likes to randomly switch lenses.
2025-02-20T04:28:21Z,"I sold my most wonderful S24 phone that I could use one handed, had a great screen, fit in my pocket perfectly and that I only paid $799CAD for because I got it on sale. I replaced it with a temporary $200CAD SE3 I got used specifically until this SE replacement phone came out.

Man, don't I feel like an idiot, now. Apple wants $100 more than I paid for my S24 for a phone that's worse in almost every single regard except for battery life and the processor itself. I guess I'll just rock this SE3 for a while, then. It was used, but in impeccable shape with a 98% battery, so it will do for a while."
2025-02-20T00:16:16Z,Etarded.
2025-02-19T01:13:03Z,They‚Äôve given so many of the ‚Äúpro‚Äù features to the regular phones. Now they‚Äôre eliminating some of the ‚Äúpro‚Äù features from the ‚Äúpro‚Äù phones.
2025-02-19T02:59:18Z,"It‚Äôs the cycle, you switch back to old styles and design then switch back, like baggy jeans and skinny jeans."

2025-02-19T02:44:10Z,it‚Äôll be fucked if pro stayed the same price since everyone is used to paying ‚Äúpro‚Äù prices for pro and then they make air even more expensive
2025-02-19T02:35:37Z,"nah, not gonna be ‚Äòabove‚Äô the pros."
2025-02-19T02:41:35Z,"im mostly joking but their naming scheme has been getting more and more whacky, like how the ipad air is heavier than the ipad pro.


the model names are meaning less and less and the average consumer will have to get into the weeds to know the difference.


kinda surprising given how much marketing has been used to signify the models (air = small, light device etc)"
2025-02-19T04:08:27Z,The Mac Pro and Mac Studio are always the last to get the new generation of chips too. I keep wanting to buy a Mac Studio but it should have the latest greatest chip and not be two generations behind.
2025-02-19T02:05:31Z,"kinda want the air, but bummed about the lack of cameras but maybe i‚Äôll be convinced it‚Äôs fine.

2025-02-19T07:27:14Z,Are our phones not already super thin and light?
2025-02-19T02:26:18Z,"I'd much rather they reintroduce a ""pro"" mini, I couldn't give less of a shit about how much thinner my already wafer thin phone is"
2025-02-19T04:25:21Z,I really don‚Äôt want this to be the case. I don‚Äôt wanna go back to trying to make everything paper thin at the expense of things like battery life
2025-02-19T06:23:17Z,That wouldn‚Äôt make sense. In every other category Apple produces air is the cheap one so my guess is also here that air is the new normal.
2025-02-19T01:57:19Z,The marketing department will never be cut.
2025-02-19T02:47:04Z,"The Pro phones have gotten comically heavy, and the 14 Pro I had was absurd with a case on it. It‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs going to injure you, but it‚Äôs annoying.

The switch to Titanium with the 15 Pro was a welcome one‚Ä¶ but then with the 16 Pro they made the phone bigger and gave back over half the weight savings. The 16 Pro now weighs closer to the 14 Pro than to the 15 Pro.

If aluminum can bring the weight back down to a reasonable level I think it‚Äôs a good idea."
2025-02-19T03:30:14Z,The weight difference going from my 13 Pro max to my 15 Pro max was probably the most enjoyable change when I upgraded and is still something I notice regularly.
2025-02-19T03:09:50Z,I have the 15 pro and it‚Äôs an awesome phone. Best one I‚Äôve ever had. I am holding out for the 18 pro hoping they bring the titanium back
2025-02-19T03:09:04Z,In theory a Ti phone is lighter than Al. Strength to weight ratio is to Ti's advantage.
2025-02-19T03:18:47Z,"7075-T6 barely edges out Ti in strength to weight ratio. 

Titanium has a significant lead in strength for a given cross sectional area though."
2025-02-19T08:35:23Z,"For real... I recently checked out the new Galaxy phones and like usual, they feel so much lighter than any other iPhone. So much light that it makes it almost feel like a budget/cheap phone, but they're definitely not that

I wonder what kind of black magic Samsung is doing. On paper the weight difference isn't huge with the iPhones but for some reason the Galaxy phones just feel so much lighter"
2025-02-19T03:00:55Z,I want the best camera possible on me at all times. All other features secondary.

2025-02-19T06:47:17Z,I mean... the band going around the mostly glass phone was stainless steel.

2025-02-19T14:18:13Z,So exactly like the iPhone X-14 Pro?
2025-02-19T01:31:24Z,This is true but I also think it‚Äôs more with the software. Apple needs to shake up iOS. That‚Äôs mainly why I‚Äôm bored with it. That‚Äôs where nothing is new

2025-02-19T01:22:42Z,I‚Äôm not understanding why they‚Äôd make the pro phones aluminum but give titanium to the air if the air is meant to slot in where the plus is. None of what they are saying makes sense. Someone explain (other than ‚Äúbecause Apple‚Äù or ‚Äúmoney‚Äù) why Apple would make this decision?
2025-02-19T05:13:23Z,Random guess - design for the air model started at a different time and will not have the same frame
2025-02-19T10:31:34Z,Perhaps the Air model needs titanium because it‚Äôs too thin and is at risk of bending if it uses an aluminium frame?
2025-02-19T13:29:41Z,That‚Äôs a great point actually
2025-02-19T01:14:41Z,"Cynical take: New design landing, so they can hide it in the news of that / play it off as being a lighter alternative. Then they can re-add it for the iPhone 18 to create a differentiator. 

Product manager take: Likely much easier to create tooling for aluminum than titanium, and they can prove out / refine the redesign with the easier to work with metal first, then switch to titanium once things are more locked in. That mixed with the environmental impact of titanium means it's easier in the short term to use aluminum.  

It's likely some combination of both of these. I'm not surprised, but I am somewhat disappointed. I'll likely hold on to my existing titanium version until the new design has the material."
2025-02-19T01:35:04Z,"If the reason really is the carbon neutrality, I doubt they‚Äôll go back."

2025-02-19T01:12:22Z,"&gt;Over the years, Apple has switched from an aluminum frame to a stainless steel frame to a titanium frame for its highest-end iPhones. And now, it has been rumored that Apple will go back to using aluminum for three out of four iPhone 17 models.

&gt;In an investor note with research firm GF Securities, Apple supply chain analyst Jeff Pu said the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max will all be equipped with aluminum frames. Interestingly, though, he expects Apple's rumored iPhone 17 Air model to have a titanium frame.

&gt;This would be a notable change for the Pro models, as all of the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro models have titanium frames, resulting in the devices weighing less than iPhone 14 Pro models with heavier stainless steel frames.

&gt;Aluminum frames were already rumored for the iPhone 17 Pro models once before.

&gt;Pu said Apple plans to use aluminum for the iPhone 17 Pro models due to environmental considerations. Aluminum generally has a lower carbon footprint compared to titanium, and Apple is aiming to achieve carbon neutrality for all of its products and supply chain by 2030. Following in the footsteps of the Apple Watch, and the latest Mac mini, perhaps some iPhone 17 models will be advertised as Apple's first carbon-neutral iPhones.

&gt;It is unclear why the iPhone 17 Air would have a titanium frame, as aluminum is lighter than titanium, which would be fitting for the device's thin and light design. We may have a partial explanation, though. Last year, fellow Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said the iPhone 17 Air's frame would use a mix of titanium and aluminum, with a lower amount of titanium compared to the iPhone 15 Pro models. Apple surely has its reasons here, so hopefully we will find out more details before the iPhone 17 series is unveiled in September."

2025-02-19T07:28:00Z,"I love how all the people who think the EU is treating Apple wrong don't have a good reason why Apple should be able to force Patreon to not only implement IAP exclusively, but also ban them from telling users you can subscribe to creators for usually $4.50/month cheaper on their website.  The actual type of behavior the EU is cracking down.  Some don't even seem to be aware of this kind of behavior despite spending hours every day discussing Apple, and this type of behavior being in the news every month."
2025-02-19T08:36:48Z,"To be honest I think apple shoudl force the opposite.

Force vendors (like Patreon) to expliclty expose how the fee is broken down for each sub:

eg have a details:  
$10 sales tax  
$2 Card payment handling (Stripe Inc)  
$4 Patreon  
$5 Creation Name Here

Personally I think what apple should do is provide an API that trusted payment providers (stripe, Braintree etc) can use to provide an out of process payment sheet (like the apps tore payment sheet) so that users are never entering card details directly into an app.   (the reason is all these apps have so many third party tracking and ads network (closed source) packages that tend to snoop on every single key press so if you enter you card number into an app there is a 100% chance that is duplicated now within 10 to 30 separate third party databases and the app dev might not even now about it can cant do anything about it.  So it would be so much better if all payment details (and confirmation) happened within a seperate app overlay provided by the trusted payment provider that does not canton all this junk.

And that Sheed should have a details button that expands to provide this breakdown.  Then apple could even still charge the 15% to 30% but only on the section of the payment that is not going to the upstream creator."

If you ware talking about work culture I don't think the poilcal system matters the general culture is broadly the same.   Things like having paid holidays, maturity leave, not being gal etc be just fired without good reason... legal limits on how many hours a week you can be required to work... this are all benefits not downsides as they enable creativity. 

  
\&gt; Arm was co-founded by Apple

Apple was involved when Acorn wanted to spin of the chip design group (they already have the ARM cpu designs at this point and has been shipping units for multiple years).  They got some funding from apple yes along with others when they spun it off into a seperate company ARM.    

V8 is not  just Apple contributions. And remember many of those contribution from apple come from the Apple Research office in Cambridge were apple has much of its ISA designs team next do to ARM corporate just down the road for Acron. 

ASML exists long before EUV and have been making high end fab machines for over 40 years.    

This has nothing at all to do with the US."

Lmfao, uh, so Arm the team and company today supposedly didn‚Äôt benefit because of Apple as a co-founder. Makes sense. Apple co-founded Arm (by the way, which is different from ARM, the ISA), hired the first CEO, used their processor in a new product, then with the rebirth of Apple in 1997, Apple created the iPod and based it off an ARM processor, and then did the same thing with iPhone in 2007. Apple literally donated the ARM V8 ISA. Everything Arm is today is because of Apple constantly pushing adoption of it and creating desirable products with their technology, which is leading to my point that Arm is not simply a ‚ÄúEuropean company‚Äù that American technology didn‚Äôt influence.¬†

&gt;V8¬†is not just Apple contributions.¬†

Ex-Apple engineers have directly stated it was, and it‚Äôs evidenced by Apple making the first 64 bit mobile phone processor, and V8 set them up for M1, which brought ARM to the desktop seriously for the first time. Apple and Arm are intricately linked in ways most companies aren‚Äôt¬†


&gt;¬†ASML exists long before EUV

Yes, that‚Äôs true. But at tuis point it‚Äôs irrelevant, because all modern processors use EUV. ASML literally would have gone bankrupt if American universities and US‚Äô DOE didn‚Äôt license the tech to them.¬†"
2025-02-19T09:19:12Z,"There is a lot more to an ISA than just the instructions, most of what ARM do is right a HUGE testing suit that chip vendors can use to validate the design matchs the spec appel did not donate this to ARM they do this work."

That does \*also\* work in apps like Discord, however, and at no point does this behaviour invoke the ""Visual Intelligence"" interface that you get on a 16 Pro.

It's reasonable to assume VI is doing something on-device to populate, for example, the ""schedule"" button that automatically appears when the camera recognises a business, rather than sending everything off to openAI's servers. Videos I've seen of the actual VI user flow are very different.

With Apple making considerable progress in India, China is concerned about the potential loss of investment and work for its citizens.

In a profile of Apple‚Äôs supply chain expansion in India, the Financial Times [writes](https://www.ft.com/content/d46e0faa-33f2-41a5-9c09-3957b0deac6f) about the struggles Apple has had in making the shift. In part, this is due to the tense political relationship between China and India, and a need to not upset Beijing.

The sensitive relationship between the two countries is demonstrated by secretive discussions between officials in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, which substituted the Apple name for ‚Äúthe fruit company,‚Äù including in private conversations.

China understands the threat that India poses to its manufacturing dominance, and it‚Äôs being proactive about the perceived problem.

In January, it was reported that China was cracking down on the export of critical materials and high-tech equipment. This is the sort of hardware used by Apple and its supply chain members to produce items for the iPhone and other products."

Apple generates over 70 billion dollars in revenue from China. Now, compare that to India, where Apple earns 8 billion dollars in revenue and is experiencing 36% yearly growth.

If Apple maintains this growth rate in India, it will take them 20 years to reach the same revenue they currently generate from China.

It's clear who wears the pants in this relationship. Major high-value components of Apple products come from Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan‚Äîsomething that won‚Äôt be shifting to India anytime soon. And if China doesn‚Äôt cooperate in supplying the remaining parts, India will struggle."
2025-02-19T17:39:20Z,"Maybe I misunderstood what you wrote but if Apple continues to grow at 36% in India, it will only take them 7 years up get to about 70 billion from the current 8 billion, not 20.

&gt;Apple is midway through a process to diversify its supply chains from a China-centric model to one that operates from various different bases of operation.

For a company as prolifically and heavily invested in their supply chain as Apple, having manufacturing in multiple countries isn't really a bad thing because they aren't tossing all of their eggs in the same basket the way they've done with China for years. If they did that and there was volatility within the country, it would create supply chain problems."
2025-02-18T17:48:03Z,"From the article it sounds like Apple isn't trying to replicate Chinese scale in India, but instead divide some of the Chinese operations up among many other locales so that Apple's eggs aren't all in a single Chinese economic basket."

2025-02-18T18:50:23Z,"Also because Vietnam already has Apple assembly plants. But population size is a major concern, and it's not even just price of labor but availability. ""iPhone City"" had up to half a million people; that'd be 0.5% of Vietnam's total population just assembling iPhones and other Apple products. It's relatively ""trivial"" to find that number of people in China and India which have half a billion to three-quarters of a billion workers (China is declining in labor force size while India is growing due to demography), but it's considerably more difficult to find that many workers elsewhere in a single location (which, for logistical purposes, is beneficial)."

2025-02-18T17:34:35Z,"Not a chance. TSMC being moved to the US is due entirely to China's constant threat of destroying and taking over Taiwan which let's be honest is just a matter of time. 

Don't want it to happen? Encourage your government to recognize Taiwan. Holding the world hostage with one of the largest semiconductors stuck on a nation under direct threat of invasion, isn't a good look.

TSMC wasn't forced, they were given a real kick ass deal to do it too, something most businesses would never be offered because of how critical chip shortages would be to the world economy. Even TSMC leadership knows Taiwan is on borrowed time and likely they will find themselves behind bars or disappeared when it happens."

Edit: This doesn‚Äôt change anything about small devs being impacted when they don‚Äôt have a business to offer whatsoever _at all_ (see e.g. [this comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/1isl3sa/apps_that_didnt_add_trader_contact_info_in_the_eu/mdhi17v/) for an example, which convinced me to put this edit up). Just wanted to correct the point about website publishing, mainly. :P"
2025-02-23T13:08:38Z,"One affiliate link or an ad placement and your website counts as commercial.¬†

Great links though that show that the whole thing is pretty complicated an you can expect fines if you do something wrong.¬†"
2025-02-18T19:30:05Z,It‚Äôs quite shit. I always liked publishing apps in my freetime but I just can‚Äôt enter that. It even asked me for some kind of business registration or something which I just not have. I don‚Äôt have a company. I do this just as a hobby. So I can‚Äôt even access my own apps now because I live in the eu and don‚Äôt have trader status. What a shit.
2025-02-18T20:13:02Z,"You don‚Äôt need to have a company. A PO Box and second SIM is sufficient.

And if your apps are free then you can declare non trader"
2025-02-18T20:36:00Z,I am happy to share my real address and phone number. But when I did it asked me for business information which I don‚Äôt have because I am not a business.
2025-02-19T01:35:32Z,A sole proprietor (an individual person) is a type of business entity
2025-02-18T22:38:03Z,That‚Äôs not expected. The wording on the page might be bad but you can 100% contact Apple and resolve this. Source: iOS engineer from EU.
2025-02-18T23:01:47Z,iOS engineer in the US here: I didn't have to enter any business number either. I don't have an actual business for my app.
2025-02-18T23:00:59Z,A Google Voice number works fine too.
2025-02-18T19:37:33Z,The EU loves bureaucracy and seemingly hates small businesses.
2025-02-18T19:45:25Z,It‚Äôs not even small business. It‚Äôs people that don‚Äôt have a business at all and just make it for fun that have a problem.
2025-02-18T19:53:15Z,Like university students. Nice job EU!
2025-02-18T19:55:58Z,Exactly
2025-02-19T08:21:27Z,"Then you just register and say you are not a _trader_ under European definition. 

Let‚Äôs not make this into something it isn‚Äôt. 

The rules are arbitrary and clunky, and the verification broken. The process over at Google was worse because their form was broken too, and every time it failed you had to start from scratch. 

We were unable to register our support phone number because it‚Äôs a voiceover recording at first, and the bot hangs up before anyone picks up. 

Zendesk simply ate the e-mail verification codes. 

And no-one at Google could be reached for support. So they‚Äôre not following, in any way, the regulation they enforce on others. 

The e-mail is forwarded to our customer support desk, and the phone number to our hotline, but the process was horrible, and we‚Äôre now paying for a phone number we don‚Äôt need or use."
2025-02-18T20:35:09Z,"If you make money that‚Äôs pretty much having a ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù
Trader information is only required when you sell stuff."
2025-02-18T20:15:03Z,"If it‚Äôs a free app, then you should not need business number"
2025-02-18T20:36:13Z,"https://preview.redd.it/k27cxpxjkyje1.jpeg?width=1170&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c09c8def72da357ff4164623e31458f670e9077

And this is exactly how it works?"
2025-02-18T20:20:20Z,And if it‚Äôs not a free app? Why should Big Developer have an easier time than small developers and students?
2025-02-18T23:13:01Z,"If it‚Äôs not a free app, you should have some business identification number there cuz of taxes?

Edit: Freelancers in all three countries where I lived have this business identification number too. It makes sense."
2025-02-19T07:54:48Z,"I mostly agree but would say if it‚Äôs a non-monetized app and service - it should be excluded.  

Netflix is a free app but requires a paid service - should NOT be excluded. 

Tubi is a free app, no subscription, but is monetized by selling advertising space - should NOT be excluded. 

The line I would draw is a free app that is not monetized but the developer accepts donations/tips or even a pay what you want. That app should be excluded. I would argue that developer is not selling anything and isn‚Äôt a trader or merchant even if they get money from users of the app. 

Obviously a free non monetized app with no donations tips or payments at all should be completely excluded."
2025-02-19T08:18:29Z,"Good points, I agree"
2025-02-18T21:59:01Z,"They regulate for the sake of regulating and completely forget the intent of why they‚Äôre promulgating any given regulation. 

The EU just killed ANT+ with privacy regulations. 

ANT is the best example of standardization between competitors to drive interoperability that enables customer choice in devices. 

ANT is great but as its driving force was user friendliness there was no way to comply with EU radio encryption regulations. 

I don‚Äôt care at all if someone intercepts my heart rate data or my cycling power output. 

What I do care about is being able to have a 4iiii power meter, Wahoo bike computer, Garmin Watch, Polar HRM, and Saris turbo trainer all connect seamlessly with no drivers or compatibility worries via Garmin‚Äôs ANT+ standard. 

Now we get to go to the less flexible, less reliable, and less fit for purpose Bluetooth connectivity. And on top of that we have to deal with pairing those devices securely now that they have encrypted data streams."
2025-02-19T04:04:18Z,"&gt; They regulate for the sake of regulating

That is what happens when a governing body is not directly answerable to the people.

In my field, there is an EU initiative that everyone operating in Europe is supposed to implement. Well, that means that if you're a company that operates outside of the EU as well, you have to adapt all your services worldwide to be compliant lest you end up with fractured product lines.

The problem, though, is that the initiative was made by bureaucrats sitting around a table in Brussels, not people who work in the field, and the initiative is... junk. It doesn't do what it sets out to do, and is impossible to implement anyway.

I hate the EU and I look forward to its forthcoming demise."
2025-02-19T08:10:37Z,Garmin already had stopped development on new ant features when this legislation was proposed.
2025-02-18T22:18:19Z,"ANT+ is old. It was introduced in 2004.

It is absolutely **not** the ""best example of standardization"", there are far better and far more modern. Hell, ANT+ is hardly used at all given that it's propriety, old and outdated."
2025-02-18T22:24:37Z,I bought my 4iiii last year and it worked seamlessly with my Garmen Edge 500 from 15 years ago thanks to ANT+. Name one other interoperability standard in tech that betters that.
2025-02-18T23:03:47Z,"USB, SATA, Ethernet‚Ä¶

Even your hated Bluetooth, a Bluetooth headset from 1999 would still be compatible with a phone released today‚Ä¶"
2025-02-18T23:45:49Z,"Haha, the whole point of ANT+ is Bluetooth sucks so bad. While USB is great it's a mess of a standard.  Ethernet is a great standard though.

Also good luck getting trim to work on new sata SSD on 2010 era device.  RIP to your data if you have a sandforce controller"
2025-02-19T00:32:41Z,"I should have said consumer accessory interoperability. 

I‚Äôd have agreed on USB until IF started making everything optional with USB-C. 

Now it‚Äôs a crapshoot whether you‚Äôre getting 12w or 100w of output, maybe it‚Äôs 480Mbps, maybe is 40Gbps.  It might carry DisplayPort, might not."
2025-02-19T00:33:47Z,"Despite being old, it‚Äôs expanded as the market has changed.  No one expected controlling LED lights or turbo trainers with ANT+ in 2004.

Yet, it works great for those and is fully backwards compatible."
2025-02-19T04:01:01Z,"They hate all businesses, which is why so many of them run away from the EU and why the EU doesn't have any new successful businesses.

I thought that the UK was crazy for Brexit, but now I think they might have had the right idea... Or maybe they were the only ones keeping it from going absolutely bonkers."
2025-02-19T15:34:38Z,You need contact info in the USA too. I guess they hate small business too?
2025-02-19T00:55:53Z,Found a Brexit voter.
2025-02-18T21:09:23Z,Everyone hates ironclad regulations until a Trump comes along and stomps over hand-wavy checks&amp;balances.
2025-02-18T21:33:49Z,You mean like USAID?
2025-02-18T19:42:13Z,"I don‚Äôt understand what the issue is.
If you don‚Äôt classify as a trader you can choose this.

If you do, get a PO Box and a prepaid SIM card."
2025-02-18T20:34:52Z,"Why should a small hobbyist developer that makes 1000 euro a year share all their info with the world? Or is forced to create a PO Box and have a Sim Card, etc?

What's the advantage here?

Bad actors can create a company with a po box, prepaid phone, etc, and still put out scammy apps.

Bigger companies already have that set up so it doesn't matter.

What's the real world benefit here?"
2025-02-18T19:43:22Z,As I said on another comment. I am happy to share my actually info but I won‚Äôt found an actual company for some hobby apps and I haven‚Äôt seen a way around it. If there is they should make it clearer.
2025-02-18T20:15:46Z,"You don‚Äôt need a company. You may not even be a trader:

&gt; Whether you develop your app in connection with your trade, business, craft, or profession‚Äîmeaning that you‚Äôre acting in a professional/business capacity. You‚Äôre unlikely to be a trader for EU law purposes if you‚Äôre acting ‚Äúfor purposes which are outside your trade, business, craft, or profession.‚Äù For example, if you‚Äôre a hobbyist and you developed your app with no intention of commercializing it, you may not be considered a trader.

If you‚Äôre not a trader, you do the self assessment as such and move on. If you are a ‚Äútrader‚Äù e.g maybe you make some money or have in-app purchases, then all you need is a PO Box and a phone number. I‚Äôm not sure why you think you need to have a business."
2025-02-18T20:40:48Z,"So now you‚Äôre forced to pay monthly for a PO Box and second phone plan on top of the usual yearly developer membership, just to stop your personal info from being given to everybody? 

Fair enough if you‚Äôre making decent money from an app, not so much if you‚Äôre doing it all for free as a hobby."
2025-02-18T23:03:55Z,"A small PO Box is not crazy expensive (but probably more than the Apple developer fee). You can get a Google Voice number free, But yes, it sucks to have to deal with this."
2025-02-18T23:52:18Z,"Doesn't look like Google Voice is available everywhere though, it's not in the UK at least. It's definitely doable to be fair, it's not going to cost crazy amounts, I can imagine it's enough to put a lot of the smaller hobby developers off bothering though, especially when the annual developer fee is already a big complaint with a lot of them."
2025-02-19T00:25:33Z,"It is definitely a pain, I'll give you that."
2025-02-18T21:39:55Z,Again if you do it for free you as a hobby you don't qualify as a trader anyway and you can disregard this.
2025-02-18T21:49:11Z,people that do it as a hobby may still have small in-app purchases
2025-02-19T06:12:30Z,"This is exactly why I removed my app from the European Union. Because I operate as a business - as far as my app is concerned - I'm a trader, but I make far too little to cover the costs related to DSA trader status contact information. It's a shame, as a decent percentage of my sales over the years have been from EU member states."
2025-02-18T20:37:24Z,Because I did the assessment and after I added my real address and phone number it asked me for business information.
2025-02-18T21:03:22Z,"Repeat the same info? At least in Sweden, non-registered tiny personal businesses uses the individual's private information in place of any ""real"" ""business registrations""."
2025-02-18T20:32:08Z,"You don‚Äôt need a company and can still be a private citizen. I just did this for Apple Books which is the same process and just showed them a bank statement with my name and address, done."
2025-02-18T19:47:34Z,"Yeah, EU sucks and was bought by Big Developer. Once again, small developers get screwed and Epic Games gets the benefits¬†"
2025-02-18T21:12:15Z,"Yeah sure, one thing the EU is known for is to bend over for big IT companies. /s"
2025-02-18T21:51:44Z,"They did here. And they‚Äôre trying to break encryption for everyone except politicians.¬†

The EU can‚Äôt be immune from criticism dude"
2025-02-18T22:02:58Z,Yeh. I‚Äôm glad I live in the EU but it can‚Äôt be exempt from criticism. GDPR was also a huge mess.¬†
2025-02-18T19:36:21Z,[removed]
2025-02-18T19:38:43Z,"There‚Äôs probably a middle ground for hobbyist and private citizens‚Ä¶

Not everything is so fucking dramatic."
2025-02-18T19:42:16Z,"I agree with this. Blunt tools like hobbyist apps having sharp limits to the number of users, alongside some of the information (name, phone number, address, etc) could make sense."
2025-02-18T19:39:43Z,No but I think there should be a way to verify the address other than with some business registration. I would be happy to enter my address email and phone number. No problem at all. But I won‚Äôt found a company for some bs hobby apps.
2025-02-18T19:49:08Z,"Lol. Small developers don‚Äôt deserve to get screwed while Big Developer gets to rake in extra profits and less restrictions.¬†

Stop defending the EU and Big Developer. They screwed up here"
2025-02-18T19:52:24Z,"Why not let the user decide if they want to take the risk when they download an app with ""no accountability""?

At worst it should be a warning of some sort, something the user has to agree when they download the app, and that's it.

It's not like having some random company name, a PO Box and some prepaid SIM paid in cash is gonna be of much help when an app scams you anyway.

This simply puts at risk the individual hobbyist developer of small apps having to share all their info with the world."
2025-02-18T20:07:13Z,It will when the EU hours after them to throw the owners in jail
2025-02-18T20:10:17Z,"You don't need _public_ information for that to happen.

When you have a developers account Apple/Google has your information. If the app is a scam and the EU wants to go after them, simply contact Apple/Google and get the proper info.

Easy and significantly more privacy conscious."
2025-02-18T21:13:32Z,"That's the solution for macOS and windows and Linux.

I can, right now, code up some simple app that solves a simple problem for some people and just stick it up on my website that I pay a few bucks a month for. Or upload the source on GitHub for free.

And anyone can download and run it. No faffing about.


But you can't do this for iOS."
2025-02-18T21:16:29Z,"Not really. Every app needs to be signed on macOS and windows. And ya, that should be more strict imo"

2025-02-19T03:13:53Z,"Amazing. EU's latest addition to the their innovation and plunging human civilization into miles forward.

Earlier user friendly innovations:

Cookies banner: Who doesn't love the cookie banners? While cookies banner doesn't exactly protect any meaningful privacy, but they make the internet so much better while taking only millions of collective human hours being spent configuring the banners.

GDPR: GDPR is amazing, at least for GDPR focused startups. Who doesn't love following 7 months process and you still end up not complying because you've missed the the GDPR rule update that passed resolution in Ireland on January 26th 2025, it's your fault anyway not being up to date on GDPR.

Intact Bottle Caps: If it's not EU, the biggest problem of this century for the humanity which is bottle cap being not attached to the bottle's ring could've gone unsolved. Now the fish in ocean can just cuddle up inside the plastic bottles because, you know the bottle cap is attached to the ring now.

And now trader info: This obviously is going to propel humanity into extreme awesomeness. Who doesn't love getting spam calls everyday dozens of times? If you are a small indie developer, you can always hire a lawyer and then pay like $10000, setup a corporation, get a second phone line, get a second address, so that you keep the second phone line in the other pocket and answer the spam calls (someone should always answer the call)."
2025-02-18T21:19:49Z,"wait .. this wasn‚Äôt already a thing? Just get a PO Box and a separate phone number as a cost of doing business, simple as that, those are not very expensive at all."
2025-02-18T22:57:37Z,PO Box is not a thing in my country.

2025-02-18T23:04:59Z,"I mean it's a short-term win sure, lots of negative consequences too because now all the platforms' most-optimal revenue tricks are on the chopping block.

The next big platform would have to treat Google Music, Apple Music, Amazon Music etc as equals from about a minute after becoming popular which is great for them, there won't be a 15 year battle over whether Apple has the right to link to their website in their app for that platform lmfao."

2025-02-18T20:09:45Z,"Yeah it sucks for small developers. 

Imagine you created a really cool app for fun and decided to publish it. Maybe it was a college project that lived on for another year and you wanted to share it. 

Now you have to either doxx yourself or register a PO Box and a separate phone number."

2025-02-19T08:58:54Z,"Some of the people who ‚Äúsupport‚Äù the law are talking about just getting a SIM card. Ok then, what is the point of the law? How do customers or developers benefit here. Surely the point of the law is to make that trader contactable via phone and if you suggest just getting a SIM card that‚Äôs a way around the law, not a justification of it. In other words you don‚Äôt see the point either. You don‚Äôt see the need for customers to call nor for ¬†developers to answer. ¬†

And also get a PO Box. Great. But again what‚Äôs the point of the law. Surely it‚Äôs to have an address for physical mail to be handled ¬†and replied to by the business or trader. Do you expect that? Do you think a user of an app going to send a physical mail to the developer with some complaints or suggestions, or will they use the review system on the App Store or already existing email that‚Äôs displayed on websites? And if a developer does get that physical mail do you expect him to wrote a physical mail in response. If not what‚Äôs the point of the law.¬†

The EU could have exempted digital traders here, or small traders. That they didn‚Äôt is telling.¬†"

2025-02-19T17:38:30Z,"Click the little apps and it comes up with a list. Just like every other library folder. 

You don‚Äôt have to put them in the hidden folder. You can block them behind Face ID without going as far as Face ID plus hide. 

Key tip that I did not know. When you remove something from the hidden folder, you may need to restore the ability to search for its title in settings."

2025-02-19T17:52:29Z,"Looking to buy a used Macbook (or possibly a new Mini).

## Currently own

M1 Air

## Reasons to upgrade

1. [New work software so longer works with the software I use to cheat my way into having two external monitors](https://old.reddit.com/r/macbookair/comments/1irllyz/which_airs_can_output_two_monitors_while_their/)
1. 256 GB SSD is cramped

More performance is nice, but not strictly necessary.  It's not feeling anywhere near as slow as Intel Macs felt once they reached a similar age.

## Options

Due to the multi-monitor requirement, I need either an M4 chip or the Pro/Max variant of M1‚Äì3 series. 

* Wait for M4 Air and buy new
* Would a use M1 Pro/Max MPB at around $800 be worthwhile?
* Buy a Mac Mini and give up on the third (smaller) laptop screen and keep using my M1 Air as a dedicated travel device"
2025-02-19T18:23:45Z,3. Buy the mini. Gives you an amazing desk setup and then you still have a more than capable device for travel. It‚Äôs also super portable and be ran off a phone charger if you did need to travel with it for whatever reason.
2025-02-20T03:36:42Z,M4 air. You dont need the power with the pro and it‚Äôs annoying to have 2 devices with the mini. Keep it simple.
2025-02-20T11:11:50Z,"Though a used M1 or M2 Pro is probably cheaper than the M4 Air once it's new.  I do like the portability of the Air, though.  13"" vs. 15"" on that size is a true dilemma for me."
2025-02-20T13:52:33Z,"(Actually, the one reason I may need Pro power is to play around with AI art)"
2025-02-19T18:33:55Z,"Dual monitors not working after upgrade from intel mac (a2289) to M1 chip (a2338). Using a Belkin Thunderbolt dock &gt; 2x Dell monitors via HDMI. Both monitors will work individually, but my Macbook will only detect one at a time when both are plugged in. Detect displays does nothing, and I've installed the current version of DisplayLink (1.11.0). 

Any experience with this? I really need both monitors working and really don't want to but another multi-hundred dollar hub."
2025-02-20T03:37:29Z,Your computer doesnt support 2 displays. You have to get a m4 air or any pro.

2025-02-19T18:55:45Z,"Hi, considering buying the new 16e as my first iphone phone, how much storage would you advise me to take ?

I'm not a cloud guy, I'm used to store on my computer every couple of months.

The thing that concerns me is the increase of AI and the storage it will take in the future. I saw that it increase from 4 to 7gb already.

I don't also know the size of apps on iPhones, currently I play afk journey for example and it's 10gb. 

What do you think about it ? ( Between 128 and 256 versions, can't afford more )"
2025-02-19T21:32:13Z,"It‚Äôs 128 base and AI is under 10. It just depends on how many games you want to store at the same time, and how big your photo library is. 

You can also wait a little bit and hope for random stores to have $50 discounts."
2025-02-20T03:38:13Z,Look how much storage you have on your old phone and go from there.
2025-02-19T19:18:45Z,"**New iPhone 16e vs 13**

I‚Äôm debating whether to upgrade hubby‚Äôs phone to this new 16e from his iPhone 7 (poor thing), or go with a retail iPhone 13 which was ordered and ironically just arrived today. Clearly he‚Äôs long overdue for an upgrade, and his phone will likely stop being supported relatively soon. That said, the difference in cost is $100 between the new 16e released today and the price paid for the 13. Thoughts anyone?"
2025-02-19T21:28:59Z,"The 16e is a super fast version of the iPhone 14 but with a monster battery life. It‚Äôll be supported for years more than the 13 would at this point.  It would have to be more than just 100 bucks difference to justify it, unless he really wants that Ultra Wide camera."
2025-02-20T02:49:17Z,"Just to clarify, toy wouldn‚Äôt for the $100 different or you would. It‚Äôs the many more years supported, plus the MagSafe that makes me wonder, but until presented to him for his birthday will I find out what he‚Äôll think. Thanks for your input.¬†"

2025-02-19T22:45:24Z,"Hi All... my refurbished iPhone 11 croaked the other day. Being that I've gone through 6 refurbished phones over the past 7 years, I decided I'd treat myself (and likely, my wallet) with a new iPhone.

  
I'm between the iPhone 15 ($699) and the newly-announced iPhone 16e ($599, available for preorder on Friday). Is the iPhone 16e even worth its price tag? Would it be more worthwhile to spend the extra $100 on the iPhone 15?

  
I'm also currently without a phone, so if I wait for the 16e, I will probably be without it for another week and a half. This isn't the end of the world, but isn't the most ideal.

Do you guys say I should go for the 15 now? Or wait the week and a half for the 16e?"
2025-02-20T05:36:37Z,"Hi,

I currently have  an IPhone 7 Plus which no longer receives OS updates and badly in need of an upgrade 

As some one who wants the new upgrade to atleast be relevant 7 years from now which among IPhone 14 or IPhone 16e would you suggest ..


For context , I am not a heavy user ( no heavy performance requiring games )and an average   User  who takes photos and videos ( not professional).

Based on my analysis , the IPhone 16e has better RAM and OS upgrades for few more years ..

The IPhone 14 has slightly better camera (?) and better 5G(is this correct?). If this is true , is the 5 G on iPhone 16e future proof?


The price difference  between both phone in my place is about 50 USD with IPhone 14 being cheaper .

Feel free to post your suggestions"
2025-02-20T07:39:58Z,God damn 9 years for your iPhone huh? I‚Äôd suggest 16e just because you keep them for so long and OS updates will be more important than hardware in that time. I thought I was pushing it with my 2020 se
2025-02-20T07:55:58Z,"Yeah , Funny part is the IPhone 7 Plus still works fine for most daily tasks ..

Only downside is no longer u receive OS upgrades , so certain apps ( which I rarely use ) can‚Äôt be installed"

I‚Äôm on a iPhone 16 Pro, iOS 18.1.1, and have found that the Notes app is using significant energy. I can use it for 2 hours and a bit of side usage, and it‚Äôll drain the energy from 90% to 6%. Is this because of AI or word correction? I do almost narrate a full lecture on it, so am constantly typing, but any one has some experience how to reduce the energy usage?

We were visiting and damn we felt like ballers that day sitting that close. Second time was last year at a Loons game. Wasn't front row but the atmosphere was electric and while it was hot and rainy it was great. I am VERY tempted to get MLS season pass and watch some more Loon games and maybe even go to a few more games.

You can't really translate that to sports, like Messi doesn't have some deeper meaning behind being the GOAT; he just is because he's better than everyone else.

2025-02-17T16:11:27Z,It‚Äôs just going to be a different camera module I‚Äôm sure. Nothing else to see here
2025-02-17T16:33:24Z,"The thinness probably also counts. Remember how impressed folks were by the iPhone 6 back in the day? People are underestimating the marketing appeal of a super thin device, it‚Äôs an effect that‚Äôs more noticeable in person. At the very least, using a case will now still feel thinner than a caseless non-ultra thin device."
2025-02-17T17:26:43Z,People will just complain about the single camera and the shitty battery life
2025-02-17T18:59:27Z,And then slam it in a car door and complain about how they bend too easy
2025-02-17T22:10:14Z,‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe this phone bends slightly when I try to rip it in two with all of the force available to me! Apple sux!‚Äù
2025-02-17T23:29:49Z,Those iphone 6‚Äôs bent like tissue though. They skimped on the aluminum bracing to chase how thin they could get it. Keeping it in your skinny jeans would bend it.
2025-02-17T23:14:49Z,"Honestly the single camera will suck. Look at any boomer using a phone, what do they do? Zoom zoom zoom till their photo is just a soup of pixels. And ultra wide is really handy for group/indoor shots."
2025-02-18T03:03:58Z,"Yes, the world is RIFE with 70+ year olds zooming on their phones. I can't even get to work because all of the old people standing in my way."
2025-02-17T21:35:49Z,"I was fairly impressed with my iPhone 6 until the new thin design meant it bent and the screen stopped working properly and Apple refused to acknowledge it was a design flaw, costing me hundreds in replacing it. Then I was MUCH less impressed with it

At that point I realised I don‚Äôt need to shave with my phone, I need it to be reliable"
2025-02-17T23:58:50Z,The ultra thin mag-safe batteries also make a thin phone attractive.
2025-02-17T16:05:19Z,Just keep in mind that everyone said this about the Series 10 too.

2025-02-17T18:42:30Z,Unapologetic.
2025-02-17T16:05:37Z,I feel like this is rumored every year
2025-02-17T17:06:51Z,It is and since they just changed the non pros I don‚Äôt see them changing again a year later
2025-02-17T18:08:19Z,They will likely make ‚Äúdrastic‚Äù changes to the pro line which will resemble what the iPhone will look like for the next 3+ years

2025-02-17T16:45:00Z,"I mean, every phone, unless it flips, is basically the same as its relatives if you reduce down enough. 

How many other flagship phone manufacturers change their design over the years. That plays into brand and design recognition. 

How often does Samsung change its design? Not very often, but they rarely get picked apart for it. 

Really all the Galaxy phones have looked the same since the s20

All the Pixel phones, maybe they change camera orientation, but then they go back to the bar thing they had before it was even called the pixel. 

Phones are boring in 2025. Not just Apple."

2025-02-17T16:28:27Z,A much larger camera bump is not my idea of a significant design change for the better.
2025-02-17T16:10:20Z,"I mean, phones are phones. It‚Äôs probably quite ‚Äúsignificant‚Äù internally, but exterior won‚Äôt actually look that different probably. It‚Äôs still gonna look like a phone with ‚Äúdynamic island‚Äù."

2025-02-17T18:43:05Z,"Unless it's a square, triangle, or circle, I'm not sure how ""significant"" it'll be.

It's not changed all that much since the original (button, notch, front facing camera). It's still a rectangle that you primarily operate (the phone OS) in a vertical mode.

^(I'm not even sure if the button or notch should be called a significant design change!)"
2025-02-17T20:17:40Z,Love the humor on this thread. Apple needs a new Steve Jobs who takes some risks with the possibility of changing the world.
2025-02-17T18:02:31Z,"I would be perfectly happy with an iPhone 17 Pro that is the exact same size, weight, and design as the iPhone 16 Pro with better battery life, longer optical zoom, and better radios and antennas."

2025-02-17T18:00:58Z,"I know people like to drop the 'biggest flop' thing a lot, but having had iphones since 3GS, I honestly agree with you. Each has had some features that made the desirable, from 4's super high resolution display to X's insane all-screen design, but the current generation was supposed to be super revolutionary AI smartness in it and it just fell on its face so hard. No one I know, from tech people to casual users was especially thrilled about these features and it almost being the sales pitch for current models makes me say they and the iOS that came with them quality for the biggest flop."

2025-02-17T16:41:26Z,"Everything software-related basically. I've been saying this for years, Apple is a phenomenal hardware company, but their software rollouts have always been shit."
2025-02-17T14:24:22Z,"Yup, AI caught them off guard.

Which would be okay but they seem incapable of catching up. Small AI labs and startups with a fraction of the resources continue to pump out mind blowing innovations but Apple can barely get text summarization right. Embarrassing."
2025-02-17T14:44:09Z,Apple can‚Äôt even get the keyboard to function as well as it did 6 years ago. Alamo‚Äôs everything I do with my phone is actively regressing at an alarming pace.

The sudden insane interest in it probably did though."
2025-02-17T18:55:38Z,"Yeah, it‚Äôs very specifically transformer models (LLMs and genAI models) that caught Apple off guard. People have gotta stop conflating that with AI as a whole"
2025-02-17T15:07:08Z,"It‚Äôs weird because there‚Äôs so many ways they could integrate AI but they can‚Äôt effectively do so. 

I have a Pixel 9 and it‚Äôs using AI pretty effectively and constantly rolling out new stuff. Like being able to easily read screenshots and summarize things. Google Lens to identify objects. Circle to search. An EASY way to proofread any text you are writing (Apple‚Äôs writing tools aren‚Äôt surfaceable easily enough)."
2025-02-17T14:43:14Z,"I like Apple a lot and own a lot of products.  But iOS 18 has been such an embarrassment.  For a company their size, there really should be no excuse for this.  I don't just mean AI.  I just think the quality is poor in many ways.  Not to mention the borderline scummy advertising."
2025-02-17T16:06:53Z,"AirPower, but they were able to sweep it under the bus because it was not as heavily advertised as Apple Intelligence"
2025-02-17T19:18:22Z,"I wouldn‚Äôt call that a failure like the other examples here. It was never a released product, and I‚Äôd argue that canceling it was actually a good thing. Better to scrap the project than risk a disastrous launch."
2025-02-17T14:49:42Z,Underpromise and overdeliver. Oops got that backwards
2025-02-17T14:24:57Z,Sucks but I bought this phone for everything but the AI. The only thing from Apple Intelligence that I somewhat regularly use so far is the how-to guides but that‚Äôs on my Mac. Wouldn‚Äôt mind a iPhone 7-settlement situation though üëÄ

2025-02-17T14:18:50Z,They won‚Äôt. They‚Äôve had ten years to fix Siri and did nothing. I have almost zero hope that this will live up to expectations.
2025-02-17T15:08:56Z,I'm still confused how they made Siri *worse* somehow? I had my iPhone from 2019-2025 and over that time period she got worse and worse and less useful. Literally would not do things using the same commands I've been giving her since 2019. I'm baffled at what's happened.
2025-02-17T18:27:15Z,"Something I don't see people mention is that, when Siri was first released, she used to pull from Wolfram Alpha, so she had a huge database of reputable information and could do advanced math. At some point over the years, Wolfram Alpha support seems to have been entirely dropped and so many questions that WA could easily answer now default to the infamous ""I found this on the web"" result."
2025-02-17T19:00:47Z,I wonder if part of WA‚Äôs deal with OpenAI involves boxing Apple out?
2025-02-18T01:44:12Z,"I don't know for sure but I personally remember Wolfram Alpha being phased out before I ever heard of OpenAI.

Wikipedia says this:

&gt; Users noticed that the Wolfram Integration for Siri was changed in June 2013 to use Bing to query certain results on iOS 7. Starting with iOS 17, it was reported that Wolfram for Siri no longer answers mathematical equations, instead defaulting to web search queries with no notable explanation.

(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WolframAlpha)

The citations in this paragraph are forum posts from Reddit and MacRumors, so I wouldn't take them as a definitive timeline of WA's disappearance from Siri (I'm pretty sure Wikipedia does not consider forum posts a valid source at all lol), but it does go to show that people were noticing it and talking about it long before the Wolfram Alpha ChatGPT plugin launched in 2023."
2025-02-18T09:51:55Z,"Didn't know that; but as a regular Wolfram Alpha user this sucks so much :( WA is such a good (and smart) tool, why would you discontinue that? Especially now that Siri is supposed to get smart it will need something like WA to access and pull information from"
2025-02-17T18:13:00Z,"annoying thing is that the voice to text transcription is pretty good and then you have siri who ""sorry I can't understand that"" like just read the text the phone transcribed wtf"
2025-02-17T14:45:47Z,They need to kill Siri and replace with something new. Siri‚Äôs reputation is not salvageable.

2025-02-17T22:04:03Z,8GB simply isn‚Äôt enough RAM to run a capable LLM and have enough left for other tasks. Unfortunately Apple isn‚Äôt going to give us 16GB like a Galaxy/Pixel.

2025-02-17T14:20:28Z,"Judging by Macrumors' [rumored features article](https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/03/siri-2025-updates/), I feel like only iOS 19 (or iOS 19.5 *sigh*) will fulfill expectations with modern AI anyway. In the end, what people expect when hearing ""smart AI"" and Apple, that would be an entirely new Siri. The entire 18.x cycle is just a row of panic releases of staggered minor features. Yes, in a modern AI context, e.g. notification and mail summaries are minor indeed.

&gt; ‚ÄåSiri‚Äå in ‚ÄåiOS 19‚Äå will rely on large language models, or LLMs. LLMs are what power ChatGPT, Google Gemini, Claude, and other AI chatbot services. An LLM version of ‚ÄåSiri‚Äå will be able to hold ongoing conversations, and it will be more like speaking with a human. ‚ÄåSiri‚Äå will be able to perform more complex tasks, and will be able to better compete with ChatGPT.
&gt;
&gt; Apple plans to replace the current version of ‚ÄåSiri‚Äå with LLM ‚ÄåSiri‚Äå in the future. So far, it sounds like it's going to be announced in ‚ÄåiOS 19‚Äå, but the actual functionality might not come until an ‚ÄåiOS 19‚Äå update that Apple releases in 2026, much like how ‚ÄåApple Intelligence‚Äå features have been spread over ‚ÄåiOS 18‚Äå updates."

Like it wouldn‚Äôt have been"
2025-02-17T17:44:52Z,I think iOS 18 can now officially go down as the most disappointing release so far.
2025-02-17T14:44:27Z,Apple needs to fire the whole AI team. What have they been doing for 10 years??????
2025-02-17T15:00:19Z,"I think it‚Äôs quite the opposite‚Ä¶ they probably didn‚Äôt have an AI team for the last 10 years. I‚Äôm pretty sure they only got hired on like 2 years ago, hence why Apple is so behind."
2025-02-17T15:06:22Z,"The LLM white papers came out in 2017. Everything was basically open source from the start. It‚Äôs mind boggling that no one at Apple was awake enough to get the team and company involved with it. It‚Äôs literally the most significant technological innovation in decades, maybe ever. If Apple was a serious company, this mistake is a multi trillion dollar opportunity cost and people need to be fired. Even if only the Siri team."
2025-02-17T16:24:03Z,I bet it‚Äôs Tim Cook. He has no vision for the future. Speaking of vision: the only product fully developed under cooks commandment is a failure.
2025-02-17T16:39:59Z,"Yes, Cook is on auto pilot with no original ideas or real vision."
2025-02-17T19:55:38Z,"I'm not a Cook apologist but Airpods were completely developed under his watch as well. Also, the Apple Watch was completely developed after Jobs passed."
2025-02-17T17:54:01Z,"Siri was launched in 2011. John Giannandrea became head of AI in 2018 (I believe). So, they had opportunity, just not the competence or the motivation. But Giannandrea would've taken over Siri after 7 years of neglect by Apple. I think Federighi was responsible for it before 2018, so I think it falls to him."
2025-02-17T14:06:29Z,Finished product ü§°
2025-02-17T15:52:42Z,iOS 18 was and IS a disaster.
2025-02-17T15:29:52Z,What‚Äôs worse? The Apple Maps rollout or The Apple Intelligence rollout? üòÇ
2025-02-17T15:44:17Z,"Best decision l took was to stick to 14 PM.

Apple becoming ridiculous, unfortunately it‚Äôs losing its real touch and competitors are starting to become ahead of it."
2025-02-18T03:04:58Z,Bro why did I even buy this phone lmao
2025-02-17T14:15:20Z,This was the year I finally got off the yearly upgrade plan and I feel better about it all the time.
2025-02-17T17:30:07Z,"Honestly, feel a bit scammed with my 16 pro."
2025-02-17T14:59:13Z,After an epic fail and delay of AI. They‚Äôre going to eventually charge for AI use
2025-02-17T15:27:19Z,This is apple we‚Äôre talking about. They were always going to charge for Ai.
2025-02-17T22:14:29Z,I hate to pile on stuff like this but enough time has passed that this was a huge failure. It was the only reason I upgraded after seeing the keynote and I wish I didn‚Äôt. What a flop!
2025-02-17T14:24:58Z,"""AI for the rest of us"""
2025-02-17T14:28:01Z,I really don‚Äôt care anymore. My confidence that Apple will deliver what they say is zero.
2025-02-17T15:53:14Z,"""later this year"" is now a trigger phrase for me"
2025-02-17T15:37:07Z,"Interesting, looks like Apple has discovered it‚Äôs extremely difficult to get generative AI to not hallucinate.

OpenAI and everyone else continues to struggle with this, too.

Hope this bubble pops sooner rather than later."
2025-02-17T17:43:55Z,I‚Äôve read articles/comments saying investors are conflating AI (as in *generative* AI or more specifically ChatGPT) with *automation* in its ability to increase profits. Chatbots may be useful for customer service triage or low effort copywriting but any other use is slightly more efficient tooling in most cases. In fact Google had much higher quality results 10 years ago compared to today both with and without AI overviews.
2025-02-18T01:41:56Z,"I just traded my 13PM for a 16PM (literally today) because my battery was starting to show signs of severe degradation. AT&amp;T gave me $1,000 for trade in so it was a no brainer. I really like the 16PM, but was expecting a bit more of a difference from a 4 year old phone."
2025-02-18T11:12:40Z,Apple trying to decide what shade of lipstick to put on the pig
2025-02-17T18:02:49Z,Where is the new ticketing UI update in the wallet app. This rollout has been so bad
2025-02-17T12:59:44Z,Cool. Been hearing about this for the past year. We could just wait until it‚Äôs officially announced before seeing this same type of post for the unpteenth time.
2025-02-17T14:06:40Z,"But, but, how else would Gurman have a job if not repeating the same obvious thing with an extremely generous timeline?!"
2025-02-17T15:20:22Z,"He got pundit famous as the 18 year old with inside connections. Probably some mid level engineer with a loose mouth or a family relative. 

His insider has been gone from the Fruit *for at least a decade* and Gurman has speculated, **largely incorrectly**, ever since. 

Better off listening to Snell or Gruber. Considering none of the 3 have the insider advantage, at least John and Jason predict Apple more accurately than Mark and have been at it for decades longer."
2025-02-17T15:25:44Z,"huh? Gruber has a decent amount of contacts within the company, he just doesn't use them to acquire confidential materials that would get them fired on the spot if found out. but he's definitely friendly with a bunch of Apple employees that'll explain the politics behind decisions/that kind of stuff to him

source: i sat one table away from Gruber at a restaurant in Cupertino during WWDC one year and overheard way more than i should have lol"
2025-02-17T17:49:01Z,"Gruber makes a living reporting on Apple. If he started being a leaker, they would cut him off from their media rotations. I‚Äôm sure he knows tons of shit but is smart enough not to openly say it."
2025-02-18T13:48:31Z,Nevermind. I misread your comment and thought you said Gurman and I was about to blow my lid lmfao
2025-02-17T15:28:41Z,"And yet I think they feed him the same low quality ‚Äúmedia diet‚Äù they give Snell. 

Gurman had something special. Like, ‚Äústraight from the fire hose‚Äù off Tim‚Äôs desk level insider access. We haven‚Äôt seen that since."

2025-02-17T13:44:07Z,And who even gives a shit honestly. Every year they release a new device with the new ‚ÄúM#‚Äù chip. Who cares!
2025-02-17T14:15:26Z,It matters if you've been waiting to buy one. I just got my tax returns and I'm excited to finally replace this 4-year-old MacBook with something newer!
2025-02-17T14:55:57Z,4 year old lol I have a MBP from 2017.
2025-02-17T16:29:27Z,"I just bought the M1 Macbook Air last year when Walmart had that sale, and for my needs it has been perfect so far."
2025-02-19T13:21:57Z,The M1 Macbook Air at Walmart is currently $629.  Kinda crazy.
2025-02-17T16:15:59Z,I‚Äôm still using my base MacBook Air from 2014 lol
2025-02-19T01:10:33Z,My daily driver is a 2012 MBP. I have been waiting years to upgrade.
2025-02-18T19:09:22Z,"My kid has been using our 2018 MBA 16GB RAM the last 4 years for high school, heading off to college this August, so I am looking to get them something newer than the current 2018 MBA i5 duo core. A M3 or M4 is on my radar for future proofing for 4-6 years (undergrad and PA school)."
2025-02-18T19:11:08Z,"Good plan! I'd say getting more than 16GB would be a good idea for future proofing if you're gonna keep it for that long, I love that the M4 can support up to 32GB now"
2025-02-17T15:00:29Z,Can we just get a speculation megathread and consolidate all these posts into that?  At this point people are just karma farming posting these articles that are essentially a tweet fleshed out into a 4 paragraph fluff piece that is masquerading as ‚Äújournalism‚Äù.
2025-02-17T12:57:24Z,"&gt;Apple will begin selling new MacBook Air models featuring its latest M4 chip by March ""at the latest,"" mirroring the time frame of the M3 MacBook Air launch last year, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman. Apple last updated the MacBook Air line in March 2024.

&gt;A launch has been thought to be imminent for a while now. In fact, it was originally rumored to be planned as Apple's first hardware launch of the year. However, that is now likely to be the iPhone SE 4, which is expected to be announced on Wednesday.

&gt;Apple inadvertently confirmed the upcoming M4 ‚ÄåMacBook Air‚Äå machines back in December when the macOS Sequoia 15.2 software update included files for unreleased ""Mac16,12"" and ""Mac16,13"" machines. The files referenced the ""‚Äå‚ÄåMacBook Air‚Äå‚Äå (13-inch, M4, 2025)"" and the ""‚Äå‚ÄåMacBook Air‚Äå‚Äå (15-inch, M4, 2025).""

&gt;Since then, we've just been waiting for the new ‚ÄåMacBook Air‚Äå models to launch. As Gurman pointed out last week, existing stock of the M3 ‚ÄåMacBook Air‚Äå models is dwindling, suggesting new models should be arriving soon."
2025-02-17T15:41:14Z,"It‚Äôs not about the chip for me, they are all more than capable ‚Äî I desire an ultra portable design like the 12‚Äù MacBook."
2025-02-17T22:30:58Z,"I second this. We really need a 12 inch macbook with m processor, ideally the latest, it fits in an iPad afterall"
2025-02-18T19:11:32Z,"I still have a 2015 12 MB, still run, but sadly collecting dust as 8GB RAM and duo core processor, my Samsung tablet is faster."
2025-02-19T02:52:06Z,"They‚Äôre certainly all capable true, but long term Apple will support newer chips for longer, something to consider"
2025-02-17T13:03:25Z,Until we skip M4 mba and switch to M5 early in summer üòÑ
2025-02-17T13:11:53Z,"well m5 won‚Äôt come in early summer, but in mid-fall at the earliest, it won‚Äôt happen before the september iphone event. summer will be m4ultra for mac studio"
2025-02-17T15:16:24Z,"Why not? M4 released in May with the iPad Pros. At this point by March the M4 chip is already going to be 10 months old. All the leaks so far have pointed to no external design changes, so why not a simple press release in May or June for an M5 MBA."
2025-02-17T19:15:06Z,meanwhile M5 pro is on the way...
2025-02-17T13:33:51Z,Still no Mac Studio
2025-02-17T14:02:36Z,At this point they can almost skip M4 entirely.
2025-02-17T19:07:44Z,"People were downvoting you but I agree.

Kind of crazy to think that the Macbook Air, Apple's best selling computer, won't be getting the M4 until almost a *year* after it debuted on the iPad Pro. I know that Air users statistically are probably less likely to be upgrading than Pro users, but it's really strange that the Air will just now be getting the M4 probably only a few months out from the M5 launching.

It honestly sort of *does* make sense that they just leapfrog the generational differences on non-Pro devices. Like, iMac and MacMini get every even chip from now on (M2, M4, M6) and the Macbook Air gets every odd chip (M3, M5, M7) from now on, or something like that. Macbook Pro should get every chip. How other devices (Studio, Vision, MacPro, iPad Pro, etc.) fit into the scheme, I'm not sure."
2025-02-17T22:48:12Z,"They just want to get the Most Money out of it. Thus they add it to the iPad Pro first (early adopters) Then MBP and iMac (regular work/usage) and then the last people who are mainly in for the price (MBA, Late adopters). Giving it to the MBAs first would take away Money from the first two chunks as they are both more willing to spend a good chunk of money but likely their needs are met to some degree with an Air. Apple made this mistake with their first generation of M-chips."
2025-02-18T15:12:06Z,Sucks because I like the air for portability and fanless design. Price is not the main factor for me.
2025-02-18T17:14:34Z,"True, but the number monkeys make it a price game in their spread sheets :/"
2025-02-19T07:36:49Z,"Apple does not bring M chips to the MBP first because of ‚Äúprice.‚Äù They do so because the manufacturing capability is low at the start, and MBA is more popular than the MBP. MBA is the top selling Mac, period.¬†"
2025-02-18T16:32:10Z,"Exactly. Just as that over-priced M4 iPad Pro has ALREADY had the processing power of this late to the table M4 MBA for NINE MONTHS, Apple refuses to give it MacOS chops - it‚Äòs past time to replace the base level MBP with a TRUE MacPad Pro."
2025-02-17T17:31:18Z,Is he even a reliable source anymore?
2025-02-18T05:42:59Z,"Man if they ever include a cellular chip in a MacBook Air, count me in."
2025-02-17T13:00:27Z,"Reminder that Bloomberg sells subscriptions to Bloomberg terminal, not news

https://daringfireball.net/2023/07/apple_gpt_bloomberg"
2025-02-17T14:37:01Z,"Are people surprised that money makes the world go round? Next you are gonna tell me that Macrumors post every single dumb stuff they can come across to generate ad revenue?

You think Gruber's posts don't generate money? He literally charges for sponsorship, and without his fan boy ramblings he wouldn't make money.

If you don't care about Bloomberg's reports because you think they are fake, you can ignore them."
2025-02-17T14:07:37Z,PREACH!
2025-02-17T14:24:47Z,Would love an Air with the 120Hz display. I love my M3 Pro MBP but it‚Äôs pretty heavy.
2025-02-17T15:22:16Z,It‚Äôs a differentiator for Pro sales. Thus they‚Äôd reserve that from Airs.
2025-02-17T15:18:14Z,"It‚Äôs (unfortunately) more likely that they won‚Äôt, or that even if they increase the refresh rate it only goes up to 90Hz for example so that it doesn‚Äôt eat into MBP sales."

2025-02-17T12:00:11Z,"I still have the IPad Pro with A12X, still more than powerful enough for what Apple let you do with it.

I drank the koolaid that Apple was getting serious about iPad as a computer alternative and it will come soon now they have ""Pro"" iPad. Still waiting a feature more Pro than ""Home Screen Widget"" since 2018.

The pricing of the iPad is also so close to equivalent MacBook, unless you want a Netflix machine, just get the MacBook."

2025-02-18T02:42:12Z,You‚Äôre absolutely right. I have an M1 12.9 iPad Pro that bought at launch and I have plans to retire it in 6 more years time
2025-02-18T19:29:57Z,It‚Äôs an absolute beast isn‚Äôt it. I bought the MacBook Pro 16 inch m4 before Christmas and using my iPad as second screen is fantastic and I‚Äôll use my iPad until it decides to pack up

2025-02-17T11:52:14Z,"I got one with Apple Care + so anytime the battery sucks I just replace it. Other than that it‚Äôs still sufficient for everything I‚Äòm doing. 

I tried some gaming like the GTA SA adaptations of Netflix, they work beautifully and I tried Dead Cells and this brings the iPad to its limits. 

But for daily work it has been so great. I‚Äòm in no need to upgrade. A12X was the father of the M1"
2025-02-17T15:04:51Z,"The A12 chip is still fine for ""iPad stuff"". It's obviously not as snappy vs the new Pros, but it's really not ""omfg this is slow"". I think if Apple ""allowed"" the iPad to do more computer stuff then it would be showing its age more, but with how limited iPads are they really do take longer to show their age

Honestly for ""iPad stuff"", my 2013 iPad Air (A7) is still perfectly functional apart from the fact a bunch of apps just don't support iOS 12 anymore. Until last week I was still using it for YouTube and browsing around it was still fine. The only place I really notice it's sluggish is rendering webpages and even then it's not ""I want to smash this up"" slow

So I can't imagine many people are going to upgrade from M1-M4 to M5 on an iPad"
2025-02-17T15:35:16Z,"My battery is pretty mediocre at this point, so I'll be replacing it sometime this year, but it's held up fairly well."
2025-02-17T18:05:20Z,Replaced my 2018 iPad Pro when the M1 released because it didn‚Äôt have enough RAM to effectively have more than three apps open at the same time. Probably okay for some but not very pro anymore‚Ä¶
2025-02-17T19:06:58Z,I use a 2017 iPad Pro and while the battery sucks everything else is still really good. I have no need to upgrade. But tbf I don't use it as much anymore.

2025-02-18T03:50:50Z,"The only situation so far that I‚Äôve felt the M1 in my air is struggling a bit is that Autodesk Fusion 360 takes a bit of time to start up. And then there‚Äôs been some situations in it where I‚Äôve imported an image to trace for a sketch, and it hasn‚Äôt much liked to rotate my view while this image is also on display. 

But that‚Äôs such a niche situation, and easily worked around. I‚Äôm still designing 3D things on a basic ‚Äúnon pro‚Äù product with 98% of my experience is perfectly fine. Everything else feels fantastic, and I‚Äôve even forgotten that I‚Äôve been doing my other stuff with fusion360 still running and minimised. I‚Äôve even had a windows11 VM running in VMware Fusion with 8 of my 16GB shared system memory allocated to it and my machine still feels fine. 

Wonder what an M4 will feel like ü§£"
2025-02-18T00:10:58Z,"It depends what you're doing. I use creative software on my iPad. Lightroom and Photoshop to process and retouch 100MP photos which end up being around 3-400MB a pop. My 16GB M1 Pro handles them decently, an M4 should handle them significantly better though."

2025-02-17T18:04:13Z,"I mean it totally depends on what you‚Äôre using it for.

I use my iPad Pro to record my band‚Äôs practice sessions. I have 16 tracks coming in, with effects applied, zero hiccups, zero track and length limitations so far on my M-based iPad Pro. Pre-M models have serious limitations.

I also use it for 3D sculpting with apps like Nomad, which is difficult or impossible if you want to get complex on older processors.

I also do a lot of procreate art, and the M-based iPad Pro is faster, smoother and handles many more layers than the pro iPad Pro."
2025-02-17T18:20:30Z,"Aside from drawing, afaik a MacBook could do all that and more.

You also wouldn't be limited to apps from *the* (or a 3rd party) app store. It's great that it works for you, but I'm really happy my 200-smth bucks got me all of Logic, forever, instead of having to pay a damn subscription"
2025-02-17T18:42:03Z,"The MacBook Pro weighs twice as much as the iPad Pro. It also cost 2X more. Plus, the MacBook can‚Äôt do procreate or sculpting without a separate stylus and tablet setup.

Yes the MacBook Pro is more capable in certain ways, but less so in others. The capabilities of the M1 iPad Pro are substantial and well worth it for people who want a highly portable do-everything creative device."

2025-02-17T15:31:23Z,"I used a 2014 MacBook Pro with 8gb ram and 256gb hard drive up until last year. I got annoyed with 8gb and I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs enough any longer. Upgraded last year to an overkill but I really wanted a 16‚Äù screen. I see this Mac easily lasting me 10 plus years. Point is, Macs seem to last a long time unless you go with absolute base model that might limit you in the future."
2025-02-17T17:01:02Z,"think back to 2014, if you had spec'd that model with 16GB ram and 512GB hard drive. you could probably still be using it with little to no issues"
2025-02-17T18:25:22Z,"Nah, the battery would probably be cooked and unless you do an SSD swap (if even possible) the faster storage alone makes a huge difference.¬†

2025-02-17T22:10:04Z,"On the flip side, they‚Äôve got just over 10 years of use out of a base model MBP. Imagine using a 2004 vintage MBP (ie a G4) in 2014!

However much they saved on the RAM and storage then may be worth more towards a new machine now.¬†

It‚Äôs true that the pre-2015 era was a bit of a sweet spot - we might be in another one now with the bumps to 24gb RAM, though 1TB base for storage would have been nice too. It‚Äôs a shame post HDD to SSD storage we haven‚Äôt quite got back there yet."
2025-02-17T16:42:33Z,"You don‚Äôt need a dock just get a display port to usbc cable, or if you get a MBP it has a hdmi port.

I‚Äôd recommend keeping an eye out on open box deals at Bestbuy, or Microcenter if you‚Äôre near one. I got a m3 air (16,256) ¬†for $770 2 weeks ago from Bestbuy.¬†"

2025-02-17T15:08:08Z,"The thing is, they wouldn't be merging the three markets for the most part

They'd be merging the iPad Pro market into the Mac market, sure - but most people buying an iPad aren't buying the Pro line for productivity work. They're buying the cheaper models for media consumption and will continue to buy those devices

Similarly I'd venture (acknowledging that it's speculation) that most owners of the lower spec iPads don't own a Mac anyway - so it's VERY rare that someone's choosing between a MacBook or an iPad anyhow"
2025-02-17T21:47:34Z,"Yeah man, you know much better than Apple does /s"
2025-02-19T15:32:40Z,Do u have a better theory
2025-02-17T13:12:20Z,"There is if you use very particular software on iPads, particularly artists and designers.
For everyone else: True."
2025-02-17T13:20:33Z,"Even then, it‚Äôs very diminishing returns. Affinity, provreate etc have been topped out for a long while."
2025-02-17T13:21:42Z,Yeah I really wish Procreate would see some more love from its developers. Its last feature update has been quite some time ago and it still cannot use virtual memory that was introduced into iPadOS years ago.

2025-02-17T16:49:15Z,"Yeah the layer/canvas limit has also been my main reason for getting the terribly expensive terabyte storage model, so thank you very much for the information, that makes me very excited."
2025-02-17T15:15:21Z,"But other than artificial restrictions like the new Pencil only working on the new Pro, how many of those artists and designers are actually using the full potential of the M-Series chips? Those graphic design apps aren't hugely CPU intensive - they aren't even coming close to maxing out the CPU in an iPad Pro

Assuming you didn't touch the functionality, I doubt they'd even notice if you swapped the high end laptop/desktop M4 CPU for a high end mobile chip like an A18Pro instead

Unless you're doing video editing on your iPad, there aren't many other use cases that are actually taking advantage of the M-Series CPU"
2025-02-17T15:33:45Z,"Have you ever worked with big canvases, like 4K or 8K, in raster image editors? That is a lot of data to deal with, meaning a lot of RAM usage, and if you start applying transformations to canvases like that, it definitely uses all the performance an M-series chip can supply."
2025-02-17T19:21:17Z,"It'll use all the performance simply because it's available, but the result is a fractionally quicker processing time on a fairly short process

The A18Pro would've still done the same job, it would've just taken marginally longer

When I say ""maxing out"" I more mean rendering where you're using 100% performance for a sustained period such that it actually makes a meaningful difference (eg a rendering tasks taking 15 minutes instead of 10), rather than a transformation taking 3 seconds instead of 2

That's not to say the M4 has no benefit in faster tasks, just that it's not particularly significant for most people's day to day workflow"
2025-02-17T19:23:39Z,"When you say ‚Äúit would‚Äôve just taken marginally longer‚Äù, on a process such as a brush-based liquify transformation or continuous rescale, that quickly means a difference of doing the transformation with 10 FPS or 10 seconds per frame."
2025-02-17T19:32:28Z,"The difference between the A18 and M4 is not 100x, or even close - I've no idea where you've pulled that number from

The performance difference is something in the order of 20-60% depending on the task. Most usually around 40-50%. Eg if the M4 does 10fps, then the A18Pro is typically doing about 7fps, not 0.1fps like you've just claimed

If you're seeing a transformation showing 10fps on M4 and 0.1fps on A18Pro then that's a problem with the software you're using not working properly, there's no way you should be seeing anything even close to that level of difference"
2025-02-17T15:23:45Z,"It‚Äôs long overdue for iPad pros to have a new take on ‚Äúboot camp‚Äù to dual boot iPadOS and macOS. Before M chips there was plausible deniability that ‚ÄúiPads run A chips, they‚Äôre not Macs!‚Äù That excuse is gone. 

It‚Äôs an expensive enough device it‚Äôd never interfere with entry level $900 MacBook Air sales anyway. Many iPad Pro configurations sail past $2000. At that level of spend I don‚Äôt want the same options as my kid‚Äôs $279 airplane companion. 

Give it a reason to exist because it offers an essential trick the Air and base iPads can‚Äôt do."
2025-02-17T19:37:16Z,"I actually think Microsoft had the right idea with Windows 8, where there was a ""tablet"" interface designed for touch that had it's own set of apps, but regular Windows was running behind it and you could switch between the two environments at will. There wasn't any devices out at the time that made this a typical need (most were full size laptops with touch screens) and their execution could have been better, but I thought the idea was fantastic, especially for a device like an iPad."
2025-02-17T16:47:57Z,"The os is so goddamn frustrating. I bought a M2 air for school and it works great for handwriting notes. The rest of the time I‚Äôm forcing it to work like a laptop because I‚Äôm not carrying two devices to school. WebKit browsers suck and have a lot of compatibility issues with the various learning management systems I have to interact with, multitasking and window management sucks, iPad versions of apps are gimped. A lot of times I just have to wait until I get home to my Mac to do what I need to. It‚Äôs just annoying all around. 

I see other students who use a Microsoft Surface and I‚Äôm thinking that they just make way more sense for my use case."
2025-02-17T11:21:19Z,"From the article: Apple will bring its next-generation M5 chip to the MacBook Pro in the fall, followed by the iPad Pro in the first half of 2026, according to Bloomberg‚Äôs Mark Gurman.

Gurman‚Äôs latest claim flips the previously expected order of devices to transition from M4 to M5 chips, which was based on last year‚Äôs M4 product launch order. Apple first introduced its M4 chip in an updated iPad Pro in May 2024, followed by the MacBook Pro in October, but it sounds like Apple will deviate from that timeline this time around.

Before the release of M5 MacBook Pro models, Gurman says that Apple will launch updates to the Mac Studio and Mac Pro using its current generation M4 chip series. Those machines could arrive around Apple‚Äôs annual Worldwide Developers Conference in June 2025.

The M5 series is expected to feature an enhanced ARM architecture and is reportedly being manufactured using TSMC‚Äôs advanced 3-nanometer process technology. Apple‚Äôs decision to forgo TSMC‚Äôs more advanced 2nm process for the M5 chip is believed to be due to cost considerations. However, the high-end versions of the M5 will still feature significant advancements over their M4 equivalents, mainly through the adoption of TSMC‚Äôs System on Integrated Chip (SoIC) technology."
2025-02-17T15:27:35Z,"Weird they are using M4 for the Mac Pro, when the Mac Pro gets updated so rarely"
2025-02-17T12:41:15Z,"Could wrong but I thought he predicted that iPad Pro next iteration would be out later half of 2025?

Not that I care. I‚Äôm done with iPads. Sold mine. Amazing tablet but I need a full functioning computer."
2025-02-17T11:38:47Z,I‚Äôm still on M1 Pro and won‚Äôt upgrade until they move to oled screens and remove the notch
2025-02-17T20:10:05Z,"Agreed. Can't see my M1 Pro being replaced for at least another 3/4 years without some major improvements, such as it cooking my dinner for me."
2025-02-17T12:29:02Z,Yes you will if they pull macOS support before that lol
2025-02-17T15:39:15Z,If you value the new OS that much sure. On Mac it feels way less of being behind the most macOS with recent features than it does on iOS. There are also easy workarounds to update non supported Macs with the latest MacOS.
2025-02-17T23:17:24Z,"Damn I just looked it up and Sequoia is compatible back to 2018. With a 2020 M1 Pro, am I correct in thinking that in 2 or 3 years I won‚Äôt be able to get the new OS? It‚Äôs wild to think, this computer feels very modern and fast still."
2025-02-17T13:12:48Z,I originally had this laptop paid for by my old job. Id rather just buy an oled windows laptop then drop 2k+ on another miniled mac.¬†
2025-02-17T14:39:24Z,I don‚Äôt even think MacBooks getting oled is a reason for me to upgrade. Mini led looks beautiful. Only thing that sucks is the motion clarity.
2025-02-17T14:40:27Z,That would be solved by going oled
2025-02-17T14:47:41Z,But is it that big of a deal to drop another grand
2025-02-17T14:22:32Z,Me too but my battery is REALLY struggling now.
2025-02-17T14:58:14Z,"Considering iPad Pro sales seem to have slowed significantly, this makes sense to me

The simple fact is that the iPad Pro is artificially limited in what Apple allow you to do with it, there's therefore a limit to how many people are clamouring for a generational uplift in CPU power. Some people want it, of course, but there just aren't huge numbers of people out there with M1-M4 iPad Pro models begging for the M5"
2025-02-17T17:53:09Z,"Unfortunately my M4 iPad Pro has been feeling really sluggish lately when watching Netflix and playing Roblox, could really use the upgrade"
2025-02-17T16:18:01Z,"Got an iPad with m4 last year with great expectations, just to figured out that the OS was so limited that I can't take advantage of the chip at all

At this point, using mx chips in an iPad it is more like a scam / marketing tactic that doesn't give any value besides longer support. Which is fine I guess. Just fine."
2025-02-17T16:42:45Z,"Hell, my 11‚Äù has an A12Z and beyond a slightly more capable stage manager and proper video-out support I can‚Äôt think of many CPU-based features that I‚Äôm missing out on. The OLED screen looks cool but I‚Äôd rather spend the money on getting an M4 Mac Mini and a new iPhone instead."
2025-02-17T17:23:01Z,That is a better use of your money for sure! I do regret getting an iPad overall
2025-02-17T17:42:54Z,The fact you can do everything the Pro can with a regular iPad 2022 but slightly slower is enough for me to get disappointed. After my M2 Pro gets old I‚Äôll just buy the Air version when the time comes.
2025-02-17T12:26:22Z,"How about a much needed iPad software upgrade. A bullet in iOS, I mean iPadOS‚Ä¶ and move on from this failed experiment"
2025-02-17T17:15:56Z,I hope the studio gets the M5 also
2025-02-20T08:20:55Z,"Yeah, the one device (excluding the Mac Pro) that needs the power to stay ahead of cheaper models and they let it languish 2 to nearly 3 generations behind.

Meanwhile the iPad‚Äôs software is a hard limiting factor. They only had to push past the m3 quickly because it was expensive to make."
2025-02-17T13:20:53Z,As it should. The iPad is getting ridiculously over-spec‚Äôd at this point.
2025-02-17T14:28:23Z,"The inconsistency is very weird.

One time the Macbook Air gets the next M chip, then the iPad Pro gets it first and the Macbook Air gets it last. Now the MBP gets it first.

Not to mention how some devices skip one or multiple generations of the chip, again, inconsistently.

At least they seem to have standardized the yearly release of the Macbook Pros with new chips."
2025-02-17T12:53:35Z,M4 pro‚Ä¶ I think it‚Äòs time to upgrade
2025-02-17T14:40:23Z,"I mean this seems logical, especially since an advanced chip is completely wasted on an iPad."
2025-02-17T14:44:43Z,"bruh i just upgraded to M4 Max hahaha. 

i kinda miss the times where a refresh took 3 years"
2025-02-17T18:41:22Z,Hopefully the Macbook Pro is notchless like the iPad Pro. The notch has to go. I will never buy a laptop with a notch on the screen. Apple should fire the people who signed off on the notch.
2025-02-17T19:53:16Z,Does this mean an earlier release date for the Mac or the iPad Pro gets skipped this year? I can‚Äôt recall if iPad always comes out in Fall or not.
2025-02-17T23:17:45Z,Do we really need them ang faster at this point. How about some cool new useful features‚Ä¶ literally can‚Äôt see myself needing an upgrade for a very very long time if this is all Apple has to offer

I‚Äôll say that my experience in using a Windows VNC client has been that it adds a bunch of latency that doesn‚Äôt occur when using another Mac, so hopefully they‚Äôve figured out how to make it smooth."
2025-02-17T22:58:20Z,"The high performance mode of screen sharing from Mac to Mac is probably the best remote access I‚Äôve ever used. It‚Äôs good enough to watch a video across.   I think they establish a FaceTime call between the devices on top of vnc connection. 

If Oppo could use the same mechanism it would be amazing."
2025-02-17T23:50:35Z,"High performance mode works great, but I really need them to bring it to iPad. There are some great VNC clients like Screens I have used, but they don't support HPM."

We'd be getting close to perfection if you could have your iPhone apps in your Mac in your Android, manage all your subscriptions, all your family's apps, without buying multiple phones.  Real perfection would be virtualizating iOS and MacOS directly, you shouldn't need any additional devices at all.   Even better would be doing it all from your iPhone or iPad, but that's arbitrarily-banned ""forever"".  There's whole fields of progress that are simply off-limits unfortunately.  \**Sigh*\*."

2025-02-17T20:50:13Z,So poor training data produces poor AI models like Apple Intelligence
2025-02-17T21:07:32Z,"This is unfortunately the cost of privacy. Apple encourages people to default to ‚ÄòNot Share Data‚Äô on most apps including their own. Because of this, the data they get is what was volunteered, or purchased elsewhere, and this has resulted in the consistently ‚Äòmost ethical‚Äô but ‚Äòinferior‚Äô machine learning and AI models if I were to make a guess."
2025-02-17T21:13:31Z,"I know, and Apple probably should‚Äôve stayed out of the AI business, Google and Samsung have access to much more data as most of their users care less about privacy than the average iOS user. This means the quality of their systems will always outshine Apple‚Äôs."
2025-02-18T12:17:37Z,"While you‚Äôre right, that does lead to more robust LLMs, is that really what we want? Three or four companies who get away with‚Äîoften in legally dubious ways‚Äîamassing vast amounts of private user data and copyrighted material to feed the LLMs everyone uses sets a scary precedent. 

We need companies challenging the idea that they need to steal everyone‚Äôs data and hard work to make things work well. I‚Äôd much rather a few rocky years that lead to a more refined, local LLM that was trained on at least sort of ethically sourced data, and that‚Äôs going to take time."

2025-02-17T16:13:51Z,"Eh, edges on clickbaity for me. If they have a library of pictures of themselves, Apple will use them and it won‚Äôt vary by anything near as much (just did the same check, same prompts, but didn‚Äôt limit it to just one grainy photo üòÅ).

They found a not-normal use case that fails, as expected. I‚Äôd be interested to know how long it took them to find just the right image! But, this will get them some attention, which of course, was the goal. So, mission accomplished!"
2025-02-17T16:39:23Z,"It seems like a pretty normal use. Regardless of the input image, Image Playground doesn‚Äôt even keep the skin tone consistent across images it generates, which is pretty bad."
2025-02-17T19:56:03Z,It‚Äôs not regardless of the input image. The article states he couldn‚Äôt reproduce results with different images.
2025-02-17T20:45:32Z,"Yeah, who knows how many images, degrading in different ways over how many days?"
2025-02-17T20:40:52Z,"Normally, users don‚Äôt have a single grainy photo in their photo libraries. :)"
2025-02-18T14:36:24Z,"&gt;	I could not replicate the above results with different photos, although I imagine that this will be possible with more effort.

Yeah. I don‚Äôt like the cartoonish look of the results I got so I never cared about Image Playground. But pushing it with a single photo that the tool can‚Äôt quite understand the color scheme for is a bit too far."
2025-02-17T17:12:39Z,"what exactly is the problem? apple isn't subtly saying that white is better, they are just saying on the whole, using all the training data so far, these are the general outcomes. it's true that rap is mostly darker skinned people. it's true that ballet dancers are mostly white. it's not saying white or dark is better, just reflecting what is."
2025-02-17T18:59:40Z,"Well there's an obvious problem, just not one that's intentional.  The problem is obviously that the source photo wasn't able to be definitively processed and as a result even the no-context images show him being different ethnicities.

The context prompts shouldn't influence ethnicity, gender, age, etc... unless those are the specific prompts. This can obviously result in bad results.  For example a young black girl wanting to see what she would look like as a politician shouldn't be turned into an old white man.  While most images they trained for these may be old white men reflecting society, it's simply not going to give the desired result based on that input.

2025-02-17T17:44:34Z,"I think what‚Äôs most interesting about this experiment is that Image Playground couldn‚Äôt properly discern his ethnicity in the source photo, so it applied the ‚Äúcommon‚Äù ethnicity to each descriptor. Had the source image produced a more consistent set of examples, the descriptor would likely result in the same represented ethnicity. The author touches upon this at the end."

2025-02-17T22:16:55Z,"This is another example of a type of unintended bias, or systematic racism (if you want to take it that far).

I remember a video game from the 90s (I thought it was Myst, but it was something else) that was so dark upon release that it was almost unplayable. A patch had to lighten up the game considerably. What happened was the programmers literally made the game in a dark room and just had the glow of their monitors. So the game was perfectly viewable for them, because they never once considered that people might play the game in a well-lit room with natural sunlight.

Even Apple's choice of macOS names would likely be very different if they were based anywhere except California. There is always an inherent bias in programming and the decisions that get made."
2025-02-18T06:40:09Z,"This isn't even a question of the biases of the programmers being reflected. It's a question of the training data being scraped from publicly available sources. 

Say you scrape x number of pictures from US news sources. US news sources themselves tend to disproportionately represent Black people as criminals and criminals as Black people. So now someone puts in the prompt ""criminal"" with no other prompts or input text. The LLM looks through its training data and sees that 80% of the time the word ""criminal"" is associated with Black faces. So when it averages out all of those faces, it's going to end up with one with a dark skin tone.

It's not just race, it's *everything*. One common complaint with the image generation model Flux is that if you're not very careful with your prompting every woman has exactly the same face. That's because it takes every photo with tags like ""woman"" and averages out all their faces, which leads to the same output result.

That's all all LLMs are, really - just devices for taking a huge amount of data and producing the most average, more generic result. And because they're trained on such a huge amount of data, that average will always be not the average of real life, but the average of its source data - the majority of which is ""the internet""."

It‚Äôs AI, it only cares about weights and data. It‚Äôs always going to have bias, and trying to rid it of bias will also introduce bias. I wonder if we‚Äôll ever get through this style of outrage bait. I also wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if this article was written by AI.

It seems like, at this point, Apple is trying to pivot into doing both. Gotta make those shareholders richer, I guess"
2025-02-16T18:36:31Z,To what? Google Maps does the same thing.

2025-02-16T21:04:48Z,"Apple would love to be better involved with advertising and that thought has never gone away. It‚Äôs just that they‚Äôve built a reputation for not selling ads (even if that‚Äôs partially wrong) and being privacy focused. But they‚Äôre sitting on an advertising goldmine - limit tracking from other parties, do the tracking yourself, and sell ads using the data nobody else can get. It‚Äôs the next level of ecosystem integration. 

And they‚Äôll tell you that it‚Äôs better because *only Apple is seeing your data* and claim it‚Äôs a more private and premium advertising experience‚Ä¶ and this sub will probably love it.

2025-02-18T15:01:15Z,I wouldn‚Äôt get one from anywhere other than Apple; there are way too many subtle knockoff products out there in the wild.
2025-02-18T15:04:40Z,That‚Äôs what I was thinking. Would rather guarantee a real case from apple then possibly getting scammed from a third party. Thank you!

But then I got an iPad, Apple Watch 8 -&gt; ultra and ever since it stopped, also all reminders appear on my iPad and when I go to check screen time on iPhone it says it will appear there as if I had it for the first time while iPad has all of that.
Can I fix it somehow?"

2025-02-15T18:42:16Z,"Sometimes, I wonder what the reception would have been like if Apple had actually postponed Apple Intelligence till iOS 19 (or even showed it off in a limited capacity, like they did with CarPlay 2. And CarPlay 2 has missed the EOY 2024 deadline).

Nowadays, it seems like people just hear Apple intelligence and:

A) don‚Äôt care about AI

B) tried it in 18.1 and it was the same so they don‚Äôt care

C) Like only a few of its features"
2025-02-15T18:55:08Z,"All I want is a semi-competent Siri, near the level of the google assistant. All of the other AI features (other than the image tools) feel like gimmicks to me."
2025-02-15T21:17:26Z,"im continually shocked at how out of context siri is. ""Please turn off my iphone alarm"" Homepod mini: ""There's no alarm"" or I'm mid sprint and would love to know if im hitting my target HR or pace, so i flick the watch up and Nope, how about a full screen notification that you've just hit your move goal? Or after a work out where I hit my body's max HR five times for 20 minutes and the workout effort meter is set to ""Moderate"". These are all things a ""System Intelligence"" like Apple claims Siri is should be aware of"
2025-02-18T03:09:12Z,I yell at siri that it is so dumb!  But it doesn‚Äôt care.  Dumb. No IQ there.
2025-02-16T04:48:44Z,Yeah I use Siri and ChatGPT to ask random question or find out things I‚Äôm thinking about. For those purposes they‚Äôre both pretty good honestly.
2025-02-16T18:21:24Z,"Google‚Äôs a moron too though, and they are constantly changing things server side, so where something works today, it might not work tomorrow.

2025-02-15T18:49:03Z,"Yeah, I would put myself in that category as well. The proofread features on Mac are handy at times. Also, the mail summarization that happens on Mac when the notification pops up in the sidebar is not to shabby. It‚Äôs definitely helped a few times.

2025-02-15T20:21:50Z,I feel like if Apple had just rolled them out as other features instead of labeling them all as AI. People would see them differently
2025-02-15T19:34:40Z,"Here‚Äôs the thing. Competitors like Samsung have had useful AI features for 18 months now (2 phone generations!). Some countries don‚Äôt have an iPhone with AI yet, even if they did buy the 16 or 16 pro. It‚Äôs US-exclusive at this point, I think."
2025-02-16T07:04:54Z,I love Apple Intelligence because it got us lots more RAM on all the base models lol
2025-02-17T13:35:04Z,Isn‚Äôt that RAM locked for AI and thus not useable by the operating system for other tasks anyway? Could‚Äôve sworn that was a minor controversy
2025-02-17T14:34:46Z,"I had wondered that before but I read this [explanation](https://arstechnica.com/civis/threads/current-ram-situation.1503899/post-43289963):

&gt;	No; if it's barely used it'll get swapped out and loaded on demand. That load time will be very efficient.

&gt;	It'll swap it out on an as-needed basis, not as a single large block. Chances are much of the model won't change either, so the first thing will be to load it, the second will be to persist that memory image to storage.

&gt;	If you use it extensively then sure, the model will be constantly busy, but otherwise that memory will be readily available for something else if needed.

&gt;	The level of efficiency of mapping memory into linear address blocks on a 64bit machine is crazy.

My experience with Apple Intelligence on my Macs seems to bear this out."
2025-02-17T22:58:24Z,Beautiful! Thank you.
2025-02-15T18:48:16Z,"Yes, at this point seems obvious that Apple intelligence should have waited for iOS 19. 

Consider the scenario that Samsung and Google had AI rolled out and would look bad for Apple not having anything, but at least Apple could try to do the Apple way, arriving late but something good. 

This risks becalming another Apple Maps, still lives from the bad repo it got on launch."
2025-02-15T19:11:45Z,To be fair Apple Maps is now ahead of Google Maps in a lot of respects and equal in others
2025-02-16T11:31:13Z,Apple Maps is not very useful if you‚Äôre outside the US or a large city capital of a popular country.
2025-02-16T11:39:10Z,"""Apple intelligence"" is just a rebranding of Siri. Waiting for iOS 19? We've been waiting for Siri to work since it was introduced almost 15 years ago.Yes, almost 15 years. She's nearly old enough to move out and start life on her own."
2025-02-15T20:23:25Z,I don't use an iPhone but my wife hated the AI summaries of her notifications and messages so much that I had to Google how to turn them off
2025-02-16T01:12:48Z,D) Live in a country where it‚Äôs completely unavailable
2025-02-16T13:36:30Z,At this point I‚Äôm treating it like an iOS 19 release. I don‚Äôt care to learn little bits and pieces of what it can do compared to what was promised.
2025-02-15T20:43:11Z,or D) have an older phone/Mac they don't want to upgrade and see it as completely irrelevant
2025-02-16T05:04:08Z,You forgot D) European bought iPhone 16 pro max with A.I features annonced only to figure out that the phone won‚Äôt A.I in the rest of the world
2025-02-16T17:42:03Z,"They‚Äôd have had to really careful with what they‚Äôd be showing off AI wise if there were going to wait event longer to release ‚Äùsomething‚Äù. At the pace that everyone else is going, trying to announce AI features a year in advance could risk making them look really behind. They should probably have released some something much smaller with less room for error or weird behaviours to begin with, and made it clear that it would just be the first step."
2025-02-17T20:48:13Z,"I want the Ai that works like google for my hard drive, I can search things by saying me when I was at a dinner with Karen or whatever.¬†

I want more Ai but I think companies are trying to monetize it first.¬†

Basically I want the Ai from the movie Her. I feel like it‚Äôs here someone just needs to package it and Apple is literally the best company to do this but they don‚Äôt innovate anymore.."
2025-02-15T19:18:46Z,The history books will talk about the beginnings of how limited AI was and how it started out in society lol
2025-02-16T00:56:18Z,"&gt; I wonder what the reception would have been like if Apple had actually postponed Apple Intelligence till iOS 19

It would have been the entire industry screaming at apple and calling them woefully behind the times for not having an AI strategy."
2025-02-16T01:10:45Z,"Yes this was probably a smarter move than announcing too soon and under-delivering. But then again, if Apple had kept quiet about Ai for another year, critics and investors would be at fever pitch."

2025-02-15T19:39:23Z,"I'm actually pretty excited for the updated guest mode, going to save me a lot of time letting others try it on.

&gt;The visionOS update will include a revamped mode for guest users, which is a way for an owner to briefly lend their device to someone else. The company believes such a process could help users excite their friends and family about the Vision Pro and potentially lead to sales. The change will potentially make it easier for multiple users in one home to share the headset. The new mode will allow the user setup process to be controlled via an iPhone for the first time. On the phone, a Vision Pro user can decide which apps they want the guest user to be able to access. This process previously needed to occur on the Vision Pro itself."
2025-02-16T00:20:34Z,"Guest mode is the killer app for it at the moment - speaking for myself and everyone I know that‚Äôs tried someone else‚Äôs VisionPro, you immediately get the idea. More content that‚Äôs available in Guest Mode and an easier way to let people use it without too much setup will do wonders for increasing awareness.¬†

As for sales, yes the price will continue to be the limiting factor, so they need to figure out a path to bring it down drastically while keeping the parts of it that ¬†make it worthwhile. I hate to agree but EyeSight is one thing that‚Äôs not needed. Can‚Äôt see what benefit AI would have either. It‚Äôs all about the immersion in the space and the content.¬†"
2025-02-17T06:36:54Z,"Wow the killer app is guest mode, don't know why I didn't pay $3000 USD for that."
2025-02-16T08:57:06Z,"Sounds like the set up they have for doing demos in the Apple Store where they have the app on a table tablet and you can remotely change environments and load apps and stuff. If so, that‚Äôs really cool stuff."
2025-02-15T18:53:49Z,"Apple Vision is a VERY VERY cool device and I personally believe could have been a huge market, the difficulty (to which I have no answer to) is that to understand this, you really need the 30 minute demo. There is no easy way to do this. Also it should be lighter and cheaper, but that's another thing."
2025-02-16T04:59:26Z,"Nah I had it for a month and returned it. And I‚Äôve owned more apple devices than most people and really wanted it to work for my use case. It was cool but not cool enough to overcome its shortcomings, let alone price. 

Lack of multiple extended desktops is a miss. Lack of gaming and controllers is a huge miss. The speakers that everyone around can hear are stupidly engineered. Having to buy a $300 adapter to plug usb into it is hubristic and poor design. The field of view isn‚Äôt that impressive, the battery is ridiculous, the whole unit is far too heavy. 

All of this for 5-10x the price of the excellent Quest. 

The Vision Pro excelled at reminding me that Tim Cook is no Steve Jobs. Steve would never bring this mess to market in its current state."
2025-02-17T13:56:25Z,"See, that extended insane curved monitor they showed when they announced VisionOS2 *is* my use case. That alone. A gigantic, phenomenal 4k-level curved virtual monitor in three sizes anywhere in the world that I want that‚Äôll display my MacBook Pro with razor-sharp text? (I‚Äôm a writer by trade.)

Sold. 

For the fat lot of good it does, at least adding GeForce Now is a step in the right direction. I can get behind that. I‚Äôve got shit to play on that."
2025-02-16T11:29:59Z,They‚Äôre going to start supporting the PSVR controllers. It makes me think they want to start supporting Quest style games in which case Apple controllers would come out eventually. I like the eye control but most use cases for VR outside of the most basic media consumption need controllers.
2025-02-15T19:21:03Z,"It will never be a mass market device when it costs more than a month‚Äôs wages for the median worker. This is the main problem with AVP, not its capabilities."
2025-02-15T19:41:50Z,"The fact that AVP‚Äôs most noted flaw is the price tag, to me, indicates that people want it, but they want a cheaper version of it. And I think that‚Äôs definitely coming. Swap out the premium materials for plastics, get rid of iSight and the whole lenticular front screen, strip down some features, and maybe even sell the nicer head strap and battery pack as high-margin accessories."
2025-02-15T20:18:32Z,"Even at half the price it‚Äôs still a tough sell to a lot of people, for something that doesn‚Äôt have a killer use case. It looks fun and I‚Äôd like to have one, but I in no way need it. At the moment it‚Äôs a toy"
2025-02-16T02:17:24Z,"It‚Äôs dead in the water when the quest 3 exists. Sure, it has a bit more polish or whatever, but iPhones competed with Android by being fractionally more expensive, not 8-10x the price"
2025-02-17T13:47:15Z,"I have tested both devices extensively and this is a pretty odd take. AVP and Quest 3 are light-years apart in software quality and immersion. As in, it is not even close. I‚Äôm not even talking hardware. As someone who put probably two thousand hours into their Quest 2 and 3 after the Oculus back in the day, that 30 minute tech demo in the Apple Store is like nothing I‚Äôve ever personally experienced in my life.

They‚Äôre not meant for the same buyer. There will always be many, many more Quest 3 buyers. But that is comparing the Toyota Corolla to the Toyota Supra GTS.

P.S. I fucking love your username."
2025-02-16T01:09:18Z,"No, its most noted flaw is that it doesnt really DO anything, other than act as a bigass screen,a very high quality one, yeah thats cool, but everyone i have seen talk about it just uses it as a big screen for movies on a plane or a portable work environment. but its not $4k after taxes useful, epically when stuff like the quest exists, while not as good, its not $3500 better. 

it doesnt need to be as powerful as a macbook, it needs to be as powerful as a phone , it just needs the ability to be the macbook's screen, because nobody is having the vision instead of a laptop, it makes more sense as an accessory that can be used casually on is own."
2025-02-15T20:09:25Z,It needs to be drastically lighter. Even my significantly lighter Quest 3 is too heavy to watch an entire movie in one sitting comfortably.
2025-02-15T19:41:39Z,That and you have something quite substantial in weight stuck to your face.
2025-02-15T20:27:49Z,"I would argue the thing truly getting in the way of it ever being a mass market device the strap. 

To use Vision Pro you have to strap it to your face, once they have a product you wear. That sits over your eyes rather than enveloping your face, only then is there any point bringing the price down and pitching it at every day folks"
2025-02-15T23:15:19Z,"Very few consumers are interested in having to go through a 30 minute demo for a new device. The reason Apple got to where they are is they designed an extremely simple, intuitive music player (iPod) that anyone could pick up and use within a few minutes. 

They then released the most intuitive smart phone and operating system for it that made using it extremely easy for the masses. 

A product you need to strap to your face and requires a 30 minute demo to show people it‚Äôs cool and functional is like the absolute opposite of popular Apple products."
2025-02-15T23:44:40Z,I agree I just don‚Äôt know how you do VR in an Apple way because once you use it it DOES feel very Apple. It‚Äôs just a new concept.
2025-02-16T08:26:53Z,"You‚Äôre conflating taking time to experience the product with how easy it is to pick up and play.¬†

It takes literal seconds to learn and use the device, with reviewers likening it to mind control. The 30 minutes it takes is fundamental to the nature of the product but is no different than any other time Apple has launched a product ‚Äî people still went in and spent 30 minutes playing with Mac, iPod, iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, etc. The difference here is that it‚Äôs a highly personal device, the most personal Apple has ever made, and it‚Äôs helpful to have someone help you put it on. Headworn products are extremely foreign devices to most people.

Much like how Apple Watch was initially launched and demoed, the experience of being guided by an Apple employee is part of the whole thing. It‚Äôs not a failure, rather the opposite¬†"
2025-02-16T14:43:07Z,"I will disagree about conflating product experience vs ease of use. Again, if you have to spend 30+ minutes to show someone how personal the experience can be with a gadget, then it‚Äôs not simple or intuitive. 

I‚Äôm not saying that there isn‚Äôt a future for VR glasses, but for them to be successful, they can‚Äôt and won‚Äôt look anything like they do now. Currently,  people can consume, create, and communicate on devices that take seconds to access (I.e. taking your phone out of your pocket). The idea that you have to strap a set of huge goggles on to perform tasks, no matter how ‚Äúenhanced ‚Äú those goggles might make it seem is not exactly appealing. Add to the fact you are being told, ‚ÄúBut just sit through this 30 minute demo‚Äù and the whole thing reeks of a cheesy 90s infomercial. 

When the glasses and OS are as easy, or easier, to use than the standard phone, that‚Äôs when the average public will care."
2025-02-15T21:46:45Z,"&gt; Also it should be lighter and cheaper, but that's another thing.

I think many would say that the weight and cost are key hurdles for adoption.

But I also think that lighter and cheaper (non-Pro or otherwise) models are a matter of when, not if.

And perhaps put another way: I would be *shocked* if Apple backs out of spacial computing because of the reception of Vision Pro."
2025-02-16T04:07:22Z,"Even after the demo... they show you a lot of cool stuff, but is the average person really willing to spend $3,500 to see videos and photos in 3D? Let's be honest, Vision Pro is essentially a VR iPad. If Apple doesn't cut the price or get big developers to bring popular software to it, Vision Pro will end up as a super niche product for doctors and engineers (hey, HoloLens).

If that's what Apple really wants, fine. But Vision Pro will only become a mass device if they change a lot of things, from the heavy design to the price and app ecosystem."
2025-02-16T03:58:49Z,"There are just too many trade-offs with the hardware. Apple‚Äôs strategy is never to be the first, but the best. I feel they didn‚Äôt wait long enough to ship this."
2025-02-16T01:48:29Z,If you need a 30min+ demo there is no market tbh.
2025-02-16T12:30:31Z,I did the demo and it didn‚Äôt teach me anything I didn‚Äôt already know. Dunno why they say ‚Äûyou need it‚Äú it‚Äôs as intuitive as they all say in the reviews.
2025-02-15T20:12:55Z,Same AI features that boosted the iPhone? ü§£
2025-02-16T13:24:33Z,"I know plenty of people that absolutely want the VP, especially after I let them try mine. 

The problem isn't features, its price. Not many people are willing to shell out $3500. The price of 3 brand new MacBook airs and a Mac mini just for an entertainment piece."
2025-02-16T23:18:34Z,Serves them right for launching without Spatial Genmoji
2025-02-15T20:31:47Z,"Apple intelligence is obviously not a priority for the Vision Pro because this is a device with totally different priorities. 

It‚Äôs a first generation hardware simulation of the future. 

People by and large arn‚Äôt using it as a normal daily use computer. It‚Äôs a development product first and a novelty entertainment device second. 

It‚Äôs simply not a priority getting Apple intelligence on Vision Pro."
2025-02-15T21:24:15Z,"I mean, that's the retcon Tim is currently selling. It was for sure supposed to be the next iphone, and more importantly the next walled garden. Now that that didnt happen it has been put out to whatever pasture the HomePod was sent to."
2025-02-15T21:36:03Z,"Vision Pro, as in the product they are actually selling right now was never anyone‚Äôs idea of the next iPhone. 

It‚Äôs the first product in a long road of development and refinements that *Might* lead to a new iPhone. 


If apple actually thought the first generation Vision Pro was going to be an iPhone replacement then it would **at minimum** have included a cellular connection and an all day battery life"
2025-02-17T00:35:58Z,No one said it was going to be a phone. You need to quit drinking the juice and rewatch intro video they showed at wwdc.
2025-02-15T22:27:23Z,"Man, Apple is kinda struggling right now. 

Apple Car cancelled after $10B of R&amp;D.

Vision Pro sales are abysmal.

Apple Intelligence is a flop.

It‚Äôs not a great look. It actually might be time for some changes in leadership. It‚Äôs probably not ideal that most of the C-level executives at a *tech* company are in their sixties."
2025-02-15T23:26:41Z,"On the other hand, switching to fresh young tech bros likely means further enshittification in shortsighted pursuit of number-go-up. They need to enshrine a commitment to the end user over their shareholders."
2025-02-16T11:10:26Z,"Apple‚Äôs problem is simple: there will be no second iPhone. No leadership in the world would bend time and space to recreate a once in a century conditions for something as popular as a smartphone to emerge. Apple Vision might get relatively popular in some years if they release cheap models, but at most, it will be a next iPad ‚Äî not the next iPhone. Self driving will also probably not be possible anytime soon, since it is vastly under estimated how much skill and intellect it requires for a car to be a good driver on an unmapped road, so it‚Äôs not like Apple could have made Apple Car a reality. And Apple Intelligence was really more of a ‚Äûhere‚Äôs some cool stuff we might be able to do eventually with this new technology‚Äù than ‚Äûhere‚Äôs what‚Äôs ready‚Äù. Of course it‚Äôs lame and pointless and stupid and badly integrated ‚Äî most of AI shit is. They did it for investors and now they have to get it into a usable state."
2025-02-16T08:57:36Z,"The main issue with AI features is quality control. It‚Äôs impossible to test and foresee every scenario. Apple cares about QC a lot and they made the mistake of implementing a lot of features without having good QC like summarising headlines, removing elements in photos etc. I guess they are now working around the clock to improve this."
2025-02-17T07:28:39Z,Whoever has been in charge of Siri needs to be let go. Siri should be their priority above any and all new products. Why doesn‚Äôt Tim Cook get this? Siri should‚Äôve been their big new product not overpriced goggles no one asked for. Holy shit they need Jobs. He would‚Äôve dumped the entire Siri team long ago just like mobile me.
2025-02-17T14:34:19Z,"&gt; Whoever has been in charge of Siri needs to be let go.

But who will /r/Apple commenters thirst for then??"
2025-02-15T18:39:10Z,"Boost the product no one wants with the AI that everyone does want, but doesn't work. Brilliant."
2025-02-15T19:00:36Z,"I don‚Äôt think no one wants it. I just don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs easy justifiable at that price point.

If it was priced like the Oculus Rift, I‚Äôm sure it sells way better."
2025-02-15T19:35:34Z,"If the Rift or Quest or even Index could do all the productivity stuff, I‚Äôd get one in a heart beat.

Personally, I think VR is too focused on gaming experiences and missing a whole demographic of people that want virtual offices and spatial computing.

I‚Äôm in the camp that I think the AVP is exciting, but not $3,600 exciting if it‚Äôs still too heavy to wear for an entire work day."
2025-02-15T19:44:53Z,I totally agree.
2025-02-16T02:44:18Z,"Meta tried shipping the virtual office idea **hard**, you can look at all the internal memos to see how much they tried to get their staff to use their Quest Pro and virtual spaces. There was significant reluctance and blowback from it to the point where Meta aren't actively working on a Pro device (at least publicly) anymore.

The idea of a virtual office sounds cool but it's hard to justify when the productivity gains just aren't there and the downsides of a headset are still apparent, plenty of people have multi-monitor setups for their workflow nowadays so having a Minority Report-esque interface isn't as appealing. There are some fields that might benefit from VR (CAD, 3D design etc.) but they're arguably a small niche."
2025-02-16T02:57:58Z,"I don't know about the memos, but I remember a brief couple of days where they talked a lot about conferencing in the MetaVerse :tm: and then, judging by the software that rolled out after that, they immediately gave up and pivoted back in to games and entertainment.

The problem is that it was trying to make conferences in VR without giving you any sort of gain to the meeting. Plus, everyone had to use a Meta account and be in their conferencing software, which was never going to fly. At least with the AVP, you can join a Facetime/phone, Slack, or Meets call.

But like I said, Meta never approached a virtual workspace. You couldn't pin screens around, and the resolution was never good enough to really use them, anyway."
2025-02-15T19:59:11Z,I want the product but not the AI.
2025-02-15T18:42:44Z,At least the Vision Pro works.
2025-02-16T10:35:49Z,"People want AI features?

Reception seems to be overwhelmingly flat from what I've seen. Nobody knows what it does or what they can use it for, and doesn't seem to care regardless."
2025-02-15T18:43:58Z,Yes I welcome that to my Vision Pro. Love it.
2025-02-16T03:16:04Z,"Lack of Apple Intelligence in Vision Pro feels extremely comical. 

Like‚Ä¶ the $3,500 product that Apple was pushing for MONTHS suddenly doesn‚Äôt have the feature that Apple is now pushing‚Ä¶ yet a 2020 $600 laptop with 8GB RAM and an outdated chip supports the AI. 

Vision Pro was in the making for YEARS. The AI had to at least be in the making for months before, if not years. Like did the software and hardware teams stayed in their own bubbles‚Ä¶"
2025-02-16T11:36:34Z,"""aims to""

Apple can't even reconcile alarm clock bugs it has introduced in latest updates, siri is still 'tarded, image playground is useless bloatware, settings search on iOS is broken and has been since search was introduced, and iOS UI is a taped-together creation of Dr. Frankenstein. By all means, double down on ""AI"" marketing only to disappoint further."
2025-02-18T02:31:46Z,"Honestly, I know of 2 people in my entire circle that own the Vision Pro,  one Apple fanatic guy that bleeds Apple , used it 4 times in total.

The other guy, a very wealthy relative, tried it on for less than 10 minutes and the visor is sitting on the table collecting dust.

Honestly now, I could be  very wrong, but do people actually use this product ?"
2025-02-15T18:42:59Z,How exciting for all 213 of you

2025-02-15T21:02:23Z,"Hope the new guest mode allows you to see what the guest is seeing, similar to the in-store demo. It would make the experience so much easier."
2025-02-15T21:32:08Z,I really hope to see Apple‚Äôs AI continue to develop!
2025-02-15T23:16:42Z,I hope the AVP doesn‚Äôt get too hot while running AI.
2025-02-15T23:21:02Z,"I‚Äôd actually be interested in one, but paying $5000 (cad) for a device stuck with an M2 is insane"
2025-02-15T23:49:54Z,Are the AI features in the room with us ?
2025-02-16T00:33:34Z,"Apple can't even get Ai to work right now on phone how they gonna vission pro fix anything lol
Yes siri. Instead of making apple drum stick Ramen you can actually work on understanding when I said ""turn all the lights off ght off in house except the master bathroom where I'm shitting right now"".

IPHONE STUCK ON UPDATE SCREEN

I‚Äôve just tried updating my iPhone 12 to IOS13.8.1 through my Windows PC using the Apple Devices app, halfway through the update it gave me an error. The phone is now stuck on the update screen, I can‚Äôt force it to turn off and nothing shows up when I plug it into my pc. I need help."
2025-02-16T14:13:03Z,"Hi! Just looking for some opinions. A few days ago, I was sitting on my couch with my 2020 MacBook Air on my lap. I can‚Äôt exactly remember the scenario, but I reached for something and the laptop slipped to the floor and the LCD panel is now broken as a result. 

I went to Apple and they want $450 to replace the entire monitor panel. No, sadly I don‚Äôt have Apple care. I‚Äôve had the 2020 MBA M1 since November 2020 and it‚Äôs only been lightly used, not even daily. It‚Äôs in perfect condition for my use, now minus the screen. 

Do you think I should invest in repairing mine, or replace it with the newest MBA model with the M2? I think I could get my hands on a student discount‚Ä¶ but I‚Äôm not sure what direction to go in."
2025-02-16T16:28:30Z,"The answer to your question probably found in asking other questions.

Do you need a mobile computer? If not, you can get yourself a cheap monitor and work using a headless Mac.

Are you in the United States? There are a lot of good deals even now where you can get an M2 or M3 (13 inch, at least) for 7-800 dollars from places like Costco or Best Buy. 

It depends on what you are willing to spend to meet your needs. I don‚Äôt think it makes much of any sense shelling out 450$ just to repair an M1, though."
2025-02-16T13:22:48Z,"Hello! Is there a way to force the Apple TV app on Windows to play 4K or at least 1080p? It looks bad really. My monitor is HDCP certified either way (from NVIDIA Control Panel). Is the website any better?

2025-02-16T16:04:41Z,"There is something wrong in your DRM chain if the app is telling you the monitor does not support HDCP.

The website may not be any better if your DRM chain is broken.  Edge will give you the best chances of getting a 4K stream.  Enter¬†**edge://flags**¬†in the address bar &gt;¬†**Search for ""DRM""**. Check both PlayReady DRM for Windows and Widevine DRM.

You also need the HEVC extensions installed if you don't have them already."
2025-02-17T12:36:46Z,will try! thank you so much
2025-02-17T12:39:11Z,"don't have money for the extensions though,.."
2025-02-14T19:37:10Z,"Ooops, we accidentally made things convenient for the consumer! Won't happen again, our bad"
2025-02-14T20:37:18Z,"While I‚Äôd usually agree, their integration was absolute dogshit.  

It felt like an oopsy"
2025-02-14T22:58:19Z,"I wonder if it is something they are trying to build, or something they are feverishly trying to keep disabled bc the paved path is to provide that experience?"
2025-02-15T15:35:27Z,"As someone who works in software, it felt like an experiment flag that was incorrectly applied to a wide release. Commercial software often has many runtime configuration flags downloaded at startup or computed from environment (language, region, etc). Sometimes those get misconfigured."
2025-02-14T20:26:52Z,All the streaming companies are too busy deciding on slightly different ways to playback with slightly different button placements and wildly different UIs to achieve the same damn thing to care about the consumer.
2025-02-15T05:51:59Z,"I mean‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs the whole appeal of the Apple TV ecosystem. If these apps have that integration then they pretty much have follow Apple‚Äôs guidelines and use the same interface for things like playback and UI. Users love it, I would think, except in cases where the persistent UI is flawed. With videos, it‚Äôs pretty standard and works better than Netflix."
2025-02-14T19:49:13Z,"Except it didn't show any licensed content, nor did it track what you have watched and what you are watching. 

Good they rolled it back, because it was pretty much useless in the state it released"
2025-02-14T19:59:24Z,How are they so behind this. This isn‚Äôt a cutting edge feature
2025-02-14T20:02:11Z,It‚Äôs not being ‚Äúbehind.‚Äù It‚Äôs data collection. They want to control all the numbers of who is watching their content and when.
2025-02-14T20:05:43Z,"They don't want to be a ""dumb pipe"" for Apple to present Netflix's content in a unified manner where Apple is the face of the service."
2025-02-14T21:08:37Z,"Too true. They get value from being able to try and steer people into their less costly content, such as what they created.¬†"
2025-02-15T02:54:30Z,Like the shows they usually scrap after 1 or 2 seasons.
2025-02-15T05:24:26Z,Still salty about The OA.

2025-02-15T11:25:33Z,And Messiah and Manhunter
2025-02-15T14:37:30Z,This. THIS. It was unforgivable.
2025-02-14T23:00:55Z,"They want to force viewers through the recommendation algorithm and top charts to steer viewership in a way that benefits them. So, basically, money outweighs functional simplicity for users. The mantra of Silicon Valley."
2025-02-14T21:08:00Z,"Somehow I doubt that, since you imply that they couldn‚Äôt then track what data you were streaming or device, which is absurd at face value given they provide that data on demand. What data they lose is your perusing; when you swap between and try to decide what to watch, they would only have what you selected and couldn‚Äôt also try to steer you into other channels."
2025-02-14T20:17:09Z,"Yo well I hope they know they're collecting zero from me because while I have netflix, I don't use it because it's not on this screen specifically. Which is a little lame, but it's the easiest way to track most of my watching. I wish I'd have caught this and gotten to launch a show from AppleTV just to send the message that it was good"
2025-02-14T20:28:31Z,They don't care if you don't use as long as you're still paying for it.
2025-02-14T22:11:33Z,If anything they may prefer you don't but still pay them. Then they don't even have the minimal cost of pushing you content.
2025-02-14T20:08:07Z,Why did the attempt this then‚Ä¶
2025-02-14T20:25:03Z,"Because a judge is about to decide if Netflix can *prominently discuss their pricing within their app*, they might even be able to do in-app registration.  It's no coincidence [Roblox has started pushing users away from IAP](https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/26/roblox-starts-offering-25-more-game-currency-for-web-purchases/) and [Disney Plus and Hulu have removed IAP subscriptions](https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/21/24276226/disney-plus-hulu-sign-up-apple-app-store-anymore)...

Currently to merely link or, Apple asserted, even display plain text of pricing incurs a 27% fee the user has to pay if they purchase anything on any device within one week; and Judge YVR is evaluating whether this complies with her order prohibiting Apple from banning linking to pricing.  The last hearing on this was December, when [Apple was asked](https://9to5mac.com/2024/06/03/epic-games-judge-apple-documents/) to provide all internal communications pertaining to that fee to prove it wasn't [deliberately bad-faith compliance](https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/28/24256684/apple-epic-lawsuit-document-production-delay-denied)."
2025-02-14T23:37:29Z,"It's 100% blatantly obvious malicious compliance and I'm not sure why they need evidence of this, the numbers speak for themselves.

In fact, if their internal communications are clean then I'll just assume they're being even more malicious by deleting or withholding the evidence"
2025-02-14T23:44:38Z,"Yep.  Judge YGR accused them of lying

&gt; ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre telling me a thousand people were involved and not one of them said maybe we should consider the cost‚Äù to the developers? the judge said. ‚ÄúNot a single person raised that issue of the thousand that were involved?‚Äù

As did the judge tasked with receiving the documentation to prove if they are lying

&gt; ‚ÄúBefore yesterday‚Äôs report Apple never previewed to Epic Games or to the Court that the number of documents it would need to review exceeded its prior estimate by a substantial amount. This information would have been apparent to Apple weeks ago. It is simply not believable that Apple learned of this information only in the two weeks following the last status report. This gives rise to several related concerns. First, Apple‚Äôs status reports weren‚Äôt any good.‚Äù

I expect the 27% fee will be struck down plus a hefty punch in the wallet for shenanigans."
2025-02-14T20:16:45Z,"they want you to browse netflix for netflix shows, not find them while using apple‚Äôs app"
2025-02-14T20:31:38Z,Well then they need to improve their app. I only watch Netflix shows when I've been recommended from somewhere else. Scrolling through their interface is just frustrating.
2025-02-14T20:39:39Z,"As long as you‚Äôre still paying them monthly, which is sounds like you are, why would they be incentivized to improve things?"
2025-02-14T19:48:06Z,"Oops we made this bad product and spend millions on developing it, how do we release this without making it look like we‚Äôve wasted millions of dollars"

2025-02-14T21:33:41Z,would love the siri integration. seems to have absolutely no way of communicating because of that reason.
2025-02-15T02:46:06Z,I‚Äôm literally about to cancel my Netflix subscription because I‚Äôm CONSTANTLY forgetting it exists because it‚Äôs not in the Apple TV app. They might have kept me if they‚Äôd fixed this feature but oh well‚Ä¶
2025-02-15T01:47:50Z,"Same, I keep forgetting about shows cause they are not there"
2025-02-14T19:35:20Z,So fucking stupid. I wish all of these companies would just work together instead of making the end user suffer for whatever petty squabbles they have.
2025-02-14T19:43:36Z,"They all want to track my usage across all my apps, but they don‚Äôt want to do anything useful for me."
2025-02-14T20:04:25Z,"That‚Äôs because most of them aren‚Äôt selling you a service, they‚Äôre selling (or otherwise monetizing) your data."
2025-02-14T20:10:06Z,"I'm guessing it was an accidental roll-out of a feature that they're working on. With the announcements expected next week perhaps Netflix finally in the AppleTV app is something they plan on anncouncing. 

I mean let's look at the evidence: We know Netflix is working on integration, as otherwise nothing would have show up at all. The fact that they then pulled it means that they didn't want it to be integrated *now* but that it's coming in the future. They wouldn't have a test version out there if they weren't planning on a final release. (That being said, yes, things do get right up to production only to be cancelled.)"
2025-02-14T20:24:11Z,I‚Äôd be a lot more inclined to agree if Netflix had shown the remotest hint of giving a damn about customer experience ever since they won the streaming wars. They‚Äôre the poster child of enshittification because they know people aren‚Äôt going anywhere. Cable 2.0.
2025-02-14T22:38:32Z,Stop saying mean things about Netflix or they'll raise the subscription price by $3 again
2025-02-14T21:02:44Z,"The feature has been there for awhile, just turned off. It appeared when Apple first rolled out the top row Up Next briefly then some exec at Netflix got pissy about controlling the user interface and had it de activated. This latest update probably rolled out with a flag set to 1 instead of 0."
2025-02-14T19:42:50Z,Agreed. Netflix decided they don‚Äôt care about the user experience a while back. I responded by unsubscribing.
2025-02-14T19:43:33Z,"Exact, people need to realize that they have the power."
2025-02-14T19:49:50Z,"They argue the opposite. They care too much and Apple won‚Äôt give them the data they so desperately desire. So like parents nearing the end, the kids lose"
2025-02-14T21:47:58Z,getting real tired of waiting for all of the 'let the industries regulate themselves' folks to wake up and realize that they will never regulate themselves in a way that makes things better for their customers
2025-02-14T19:46:27Z,Their incentive is profit. Not serving the people.
2025-02-14T19:36:03Z,"Oh no we accidentally wrote, tested, and deployed integration code, silly us!"
2025-02-14T20:35:13Z,"Probably something they were testing internally behind a feature flag, not sure how something like that would accidentally be toggled on for users in production though ü§î"
2025-02-14T21:22:05Z,I can definitely see it. Mostly because I work in tech and have 100% toggled a feature flag in production instead of dev on accident üôÉ
2025-02-14T20:44:20Z,Bug in gating probably.
2025-02-14T19:57:09Z,"It‚Äôs funny how my thoughts have evolved over this day of Netflix news.

My first thought after the initial news was, ‚ÄúHow cool! It‚Äôs finally happening!‚Äù

My second thought after the feature being pulled was, ‚ÄúOK maybe this is a part of the Apple announcements next week and leaked too early.‚Äù

My third thought after Netflix‚Äôs statement was, ‚ÄúMy first two thoughts were wishful thinking. F Netflix! They wont lets us eat!‚Äù"
2025-02-14T20:19:30Z,"Netflix says the one improvement it made for its customers was a mistake. The feature will be removed, the subscription priced raised by $5 a month"
2025-02-14T19:42:07Z,The only thing that‚Äôs a mistake about Netflix is that they keep hiking up their prices and people are still paying for it.
2025-02-14T22:57:02Z,"So, not a mistake then."
2025-02-15T00:49:24Z,"Market forces, how do those work?"
2025-02-14T22:54:08Z,Me with plex üóø
2025-02-15T03:08:22Z,They probably have meetings every week where management demands to know which shows haven‚Äôt been cancelled yet and why not!
2025-02-14T19:35:46Z,"Mistake? Lol some dev went rogue and turned on that feature without anyone catching it before release

Edit: i can‚Äôt spell"
2025-02-14T19:38:41Z,"How is that even a mistake? If I have a spelling mistake in my PR it‚Äôs rejected‚Ä¶.

Probably a feature still in the works and wasn‚Äôt intended to be turned on"
2025-02-14T19:40:27Z,"Or some product manager decided to do it without approval from higher ups, then some director/VP saw it and said ‚ÄúF no, no integration with their app!‚Äù and they‚Äôre rolling it back¬†"
2025-02-14T19:46:55Z,"A dev put on makeup? üíÑ 

Or they went *rogue*?"
2025-02-14T21:14:22Z,"Given they just emailed me to say they‚Äôre increasing my price, seems like a good time to cut the Netflix cord for me"
2025-02-14T21:07:03Z,"They hit the ""add feature"" button instead of ""raise prices again"". Oops!"
2025-02-14T20:43:39Z,Why does Chromecast/Google TV have Netflix watchlist integration but they won‚Äôt do it for Apple TV?
2025-02-14T19:55:28Z,I haven‚Äôt had Netflix in a couple years and they are doing everything in their power to keep it that way. Every time I see a price increase I have a chuckle.
2025-02-14T19:41:50Z,'oh we made a thing people want? TAKE IT DOWN NOW!!'
2025-02-14T19:43:05Z,It‚Äôs complete bs because they support watchlist on Roku up next. This is just big company dick swinging at its finest.
2025-02-14T22:21:44Z,"This is stupid, Apple's app integrates really well with prime and binge for example and keeps your TV shows front and centre.

I think I might have to cancel Netflix for a while."
2025-02-15T03:48:48Z,"friendly reminder to go and cancel streaming services you haven't opened up in the past few weeks or aren't using and find it a chore to pick something to watch. 

You can always start up again when you get the itch to watch something bad enough. 

In the mean time save some dough and make them realize you won't just keep paying for something wihtout a good reason. 

I canceled netflix in like 2018? and managed to make it all the way through covid and till today without it lol. It's not water. (and that's with a wife and 3 kids)"
2025-02-14T19:46:48Z,Application support doesn't write itself.
2025-02-14T22:24:24Z,"Hey Netflix. Sorry, my $25 per month subscription was a mistake as well. I‚Äôll fix that."
2025-02-15T00:51:24Z,Who wants to bet me $100 that this guy is not canceling his Netflix subscription?
2025-02-15T01:08:51Z,I‚Äôll bet you. Put the money in escrow and I‚Äôll send you proof by end of day.
2025-02-14T19:48:19Z,"The joke's on them, I go through the Apple TV app 95% of the time and forget that I even have Netflix.  I would legit watch more Netflix stuff if it was integrated."
2025-02-14T19:48:57Z,If you have netflix and don't use it you are doing them a favor lol
2025-02-14T19:55:18Z,Joke‚Äòs on you if you pay them without using the hell out of them
2025-02-14T19:49:52Z,Everyone go log Netflix support tickets and at least complain about it.
2025-02-15T01:45:18Z,Screw Netflix. I refuse to subscribe to them
2025-02-14T19:44:14Z,"F\*ck Netflix, they suck. Probably leaks user watch data to the OS maker and Science forbid anyone learns the truth about how little time someone needs to ""watch"" something to be part of their data."
2025-02-14T19:58:28Z,"Curious ""mistake"", guessing integration is coming eventually but they are not ready to announce it just yet."
2025-02-14T20:11:04Z,How does one build something by mistake?
2025-02-14T20:14:34Z,I hope this hammers into Netflix's thick skulls that *consumers freakin' want this*!
2025-02-14T20:31:08Z,Netflix just hates Apple AND its fans.
2025-02-14T21:03:49Z,lol I was literally just thinking I‚Äôm much more likely to keep Netflix and watch more of it. Think I‚Äôll just cancel it now as I‚Äôm not watching anything on it at the moment.
2025-02-14T23:07:23Z,"Makes me curious about the nature of this bug, given the Partner Requirements aren‚Äôt something you stumble into turning on. https://tvpartners.apple.com/support/3314-apple-tv-channels-partnership-requirements"
2025-02-14T23:50:23Z,This. I did some digging as well and it's not an easy process to get done in a quick manner. They're definitely working on making this happen but they accidentally set the testing version of it from public to internal.
2025-02-14T23:07:34Z,"How can such a carefully coordinated integration, which likely took thousands of hours of technoserf time, be ‚Äúa mistake‚Äù?

2025-02-14T23:47:53Z,eat shit Netflix
2025-02-15T00:37:02Z,I need my Apple TV but I don't need Netflix.
2025-02-15T04:10:04Z,My thoughts of signing back up for Netflix were similarly short lived
2025-02-15T10:27:43Z,"I don‚Äôt watch anything from Netflix most of the time because my shield and Apple TV keeps recommending stuff from other streaming services. Lets me pick off where I left. 

I actually have left multiple series and movies like this. 

Netflix has always been run by idiots. Expect nothing more."

2025-02-14T23:40:35Z,I figured it'd be on Woodward.  A lot of businesses have/are setting up shop there including mobile carriers like Verizon and its creating a positive feedback loop with the foot traffic and street car transit.  Also helps that it's near an entertainment district which regularly attracts people to the area.
2025-02-15T02:14:35Z,That area is starting to become Detroit‚Äôs version of the Magnificent Mile with all those developments happening these days.
2025-02-14T23:59:40Z,"Before any of you all start with your dumbass hot takes, Detroit has changed MASSIVELY in last decade. It might as well be a different city entirely.

Anyone who‚Äôs surprised, and/or worried, clearly have an image of the city that hasn‚Äôt been accurate since MAYBE 2010"
2025-02-15T03:34:07Z,"I‚Äôve only been twice now: 2003 and 2023. The difference in downtown is more than night and day. I hung out with locals in the city, got good food and drink, road a city bike to Michigan central, and bowled at that alley using the q line to get there

Y‚Äôall have a dope city and anyone saying otherwise is full of shit. See you this summer"
2025-02-15T04:20:32Z,"Downtown Detroit has more character and is nicer than most downtowns in the south, including cities that are much larger than it."
2025-02-16T13:49:34Z,"Detroit by all measure historically should be a top 5 economic city like it was in the early to mid 1900s.  The ""bones"" of the city are still there and I would love to see its resurgence.  I travelled there in the mid to late 2010's and its growth was incredible.  The people were much nicer than NY or almost any west coast city I went to.  The whole bad rap comes from an economically depressed city which is now on the rise again"
2025-02-16T20:28:02Z,"First growth last year in decades. City is coming back.

Also, if teams make the playoffs it‚Äôs technically possible to do a triple header in sports:

Day baseball, afternoon football, evening hockey / basketball. All 3 sports arena, with the four teams, within 2-3 blocks of each other. It‚Äôs on my bucket list if the timing ever hits again."
2025-02-15T05:33:39Z,Downtown Detroit is fucking awesome now. Easy to spend an entire weekend there. The turnaround is incredible
2025-02-15T04:41:22Z,"I used to party in Detroit for years when it was still pretty run down and had a bad event occur almost every time near the end of my visiting. My friend recently went downtown again (I think the NFL draft maybe?) and he said he was shocked at how much had changed for the better. Apparently looks like a completely different city now with people all over the place. I haven't been down there yet but sounds promising compared to 15+ years ago, I can see why Apple feels safer with the option now. 

Amazing city with tons of passionate creative people and good times to be had regardless of the decade tho, so glad it's had a turn around the last few years so much we see stuff like this as well. (hopefully they can keep it up too, seeing all stats like homicides/carjackings/etc dropping to decade lows is such an achievement)"
2025-02-15T00:11:56Z,"I agree, it‚Äôs an amazing city and the people there have a serious spirit of ingenuity. It‚Äôs not like your average rustbelt shit hole (respectfully - also I‚Äôm from the region so I‚Äôm allowed)  

The city is thriving, people recycle things in the coolest ways, they use the available spaces in the coolest ways and there is even a wonderful botanical garden there.

Food is insane in Detroit and the pizza?! Literally the best in the country. Nothing beats Detroit style.

In Cleveland, its chains, its places rich people hang out, it‚Äôs a generic stuff with a couple cool odds and ends in different places, but nothing exceptionally cool.

In Detroit, the coffee shop doesn‚Äôt have a sign, just a map location and the bar they serve you at is built on an old conveyer belt, the walls of the pizza shop are old bowling alley floor, the air bnb has a chandelier made of recycled materials hanging on a picture frame. It‚Äôs literally this post industrial wasteland paradise and I encourage anyone to give it a real go if you‚Äôre able to explore the place. Wonderful truly great city.

It‚Äôs honestly too bad they‚Äôll get an Apple Store. Poor Detroit haha"
2025-02-15T00:50:44Z,"most of what you said is great and true but I'll absolutely argue your pizza point. 

been to detroit, been to new haven."
2025-02-15T01:28:51Z,Best spot Michigan &amp; Trumbull truly made me a believer I‚Äôll travel to Detroit just to go there check it out if you‚Äôre around
2025-02-15T01:32:32Z,I'll be sure to check it out!
2025-02-15T02:10:43Z,Best part is that you can get decent new haven style in Detroit too at tomatoes apizza
2025-02-15T22:28:59Z,New Haven üòÇ
2025-02-15T23:01:40Z,"best ive had in the world, and I've had pizza in all 50 states and 8 countries"
2025-02-15T23:02:44Z,I disagree but that‚Äôs cool.
2025-02-15T23:17:43Z,well what's your favorite spot? I'll 100% check it out if/when I'm in the area. I love pizza in general and love trying new spots
2025-02-16T18:31:40Z,Loui‚Äôs Pizza in Hazel Park is top notch

2025-02-15T02:06:54Z,Ex-Chicagoan here and this is accurate. 2nd best city in the Midwest imo and it‚Äôs not even close. The city‚Äôs spirit is amazing
2025-02-15T01:34:20Z,Best pizza in the country lol please be fr
2025-02-15T01:37:23Z,I‚Äôm telling you - go try the pizza at Michigan and Trumbull and report back.
2025-02-15T17:43:14Z,That‚Äôs all well and good but Detroit style pizza is casserole cosplaying as real pizza. Get out of here with that.
2025-02-15T19:04:36Z,You‚Äôve never had a real one then.
2025-02-15T19:49:23Z,Are you thinking of Chicago style?
2025-02-15T22:49:39Z,I think they are.

LOL."
2025-02-15T01:15:50Z,It is. I visit downtown twice a year and have never once felt unsafe. It isn‚Äôt the 90s Detroit that you think you know.
2025-02-15T00:35:44Z,You don‚Äôt see flash mobs of kids running the streets of downtown smashing windows and beating people up like you do in Chicago.  There‚Äôs a reason they have summer curfews.

2025-02-15T07:50:13Z,And they haven't even mentioned battery size. It better be a decent size this time :(
2025-02-15T08:10:33Z,"That would be a welcome change. With all the technologies constantly improving, I feel like battery innovation really lacks behind"
2025-02-15T08:11:48Z,"Yeah, there are some Chinese phones with denser batteries with a 6,000 mAh capacity and things like that. Hopefully Apple improves that too."
2025-02-15T08:19:08Z,"We can only hope. Apple is mostly design over function, and they‚Äôll only want to make it slimmer and lighter when possible if they get the chance. We‚Äôll see"
2025-02-14T22:13:50Z,Really hoping they leave that as opt in. I don‚Äôt want that garbage nor do I want it to waste space.
2025-02-14T20:23:42Z,"Current iPhone SE is $429 and upgrading to 128gb storage is $50 putting it at $479. I remember when I got my iPhone 12 mini it was $50 to upgrade to 128gb as well. If the SE 4 costs $499 and if it comes with 64gb base storage I would expect it to cost $50 to upgrade to 128 as well, not $100. Otherwise it would be the exact same cost as iPhone 14 which has a base storage of 128 as well. That doesn‚Äôt make it impossible they would do that but I think it‚Äôs exceedingly unlikely."
2025-02-15T03:57:02Z,"Yeah my guess is that they‚Äôll do a $50 step up knowing that most people would want more than 64gb and that‚Äôll make the realistic usable base price more like $549. They don‚Äôt really want to cannibalize too many iPhone 16 sales either so it makes sense to get the prices close enough to make you reconsider the cheapest option.

But hopefully we see some decent deals, I feel like there are always a lot of SE deals in general since the customers are more price conscious"
2025-02-15T10:56:30Z,"Problem is most people that buy the SE will just go for 64gb and complain that they have no storage. The SE is the price conscious end of the market, no way they are upgrading storage."
2025-02-15T19:43:03Z,with 64gb in 2025 you'll either be forced to get cloud storage or delete pictures and videos on a monthly basis
2025-02-17T17:58:45Z,"I have SE 2020 64 GB and I am deleting things not-stop, with most apps uninstalled. I can‚Äôt even install the latest updates because an update last year blocked a lot of space permanently, so that my phone is just screwed totally.

64 GB is not viable anymore in 2025."
2025-02-16T03:20:01Z,I wouldn‚Äôt buy a 64GB and I don‚Äôt think they should ship it with 64 either but it‚Äôs really not THAT bad.. it‚Äôs at least usable and for many people would be MORE than enough. I know people who can‚Äôt even use a whole 64GB. Some of you haven‚Äôt lived with 16GB and it shows lol
2025-02-16T15:10:34Z,I‚Äôve got the SE3 with 64GB and I‚Äôve still got 29GB free.
2025-02-16T04:24:06Z,"I know what's like to live with 5MB of storage on a Razr V3, but that's a dumb comparison, a single picture of a modern iphone takes 2-5MB, take itnto video and just at 1080p, 64GB are full in 2-6 hours, so like I said, the people buying a 64GB smartphone in 2025 WILL have to delete data on a constant basis or get cloud storage."
2025-02-14T21:12:32Z,"Me reading the headline: Wait, like 512GB? 

After reading the article: Ohhhhh, that kind of ridiculous."
2025-02-16T03:33:11Z,512GB is good but not ridiculous. 2TB would be though lol. In all seriousness they need to have three storage tiers 128/256/512GB
2025-02-16T10:14:46Z,the article mentions base storage so 512Gb is ridiciuous. but we know thats not gonna happen right now.
2025-02-14T20:12:31Z,"&gt;In that case, expect the 128GB iPhone SE 4 to be $599, and the 256GB model to go for $699, which is just funny.¬†

I've commented this exact strategy several times in the past couple weeks. It's the only thing that makes sense for a phone with specs that are so close to the iPhone 16. By not having a 128GB version, the price of the 256GB version puts you close enough to the price of the 16 that you have to consider it. This is a classic pull through pricing strategy. They did the exact same thing with the iPad Air vs iPad Pro a couple years ago. They do the same thing with the base iPad vs the Air today.

2025-02-14T20:48:10Z,It's the pricing ladder and Apple is very good at it.
2025-02-14T22:50:11Z,Whats a price ladder? Is it something like i want ipad - 256gigs for me -  but then it costs the same as a ipad pro - but 256gb is needed on that aswell so the price keeps growing?
2025-02-14T23:03:24Z,Exactly.
2025-02-15T04:24:19Z,"Step one: is base model you would be ok with but lacking one thing. ~ 50 dollars 

Step two: is base model upgraded ~100 dollars 

Step three: is better model unupgraded ~125 dollars. 

Step four: upgraded and better model ~175 dollars. 

You mentally start climbing the latter till they get you where they want."

This video is a pretty good explanation."
2025-02-14T21:30:49Z,"the lack of a 128GB SKU on the ipad air is so hilariously intentional that i laughed irl when i saw it. whoever they've got on pricing is a monster, big respect"
2025-02-14T21:45:46Z,"It worked on me though, because 64GB wasn't enough and at the 256GB price point, there was no reason not to spend a little more for the 128GB M1 Pro. I'm still using that iPad today."
2025-02-15T02:11:38Z,Nvidia should hire them next¬†

2025-02-15T06:55:57Z,"Nvidia doesn't need a ladder, they just price everything at one kidney and the daily rate determines the price of that year's flagship"
2025-02-14T20:35:59Z,"64 gb starting storage, saved you a click"
2025-02-14T21:00:08Z,"It will start at 128GB. Apple has phased 64 out and it would be more expensive for them to do it. They‚Äôll just price it accordingly.

The AW Ultra has a 64GB chip, but I doubt that‚Äôll have any effect on the SE."
2025-02-14T21:26:16Z,"base ipad still comes with 64gb. Apple is here to make profits, $100 for extra 64gb will be the case for the new SE"
2025-02-14T21:29:16Z,"base ipad is almost 3 years old. if they're going to maintain that kind of cycle, 64GB is extremely unlikely"
2025-02-14T22:12:21Z,"No, base iPad *came* with 64GB of storage, *in 2022.*

Apple already has suppliers for 128GB chips, given the volumes of those they get, it'll be cheaper for them to make the base that and bump the price up accordingly, than to source 64GB in much smaller volumes.

Also if I'm not mistaken, the upgrade to 128GB has been $50 for years now. They'll be adjusting the pricing for inflation, they'll easily make it work."
2025-02-16T03:26:45Z,They should have phased out 64GB with the SE3 and at the same time introduced a 512GB SE.
2025-02-14T21:03:07Z,"Thank you. I didn't know if they meant ridiculously good or ridiculously bad. In hindsight, I should have known, but I'm optomistic by nature."
2025-02-14T22:06:39Z,Ridiculous in 2010 maybe.
2025-02-15T02:36:21Z,It‚Äôs ridiculous in the opposite direction in 2025.
2025-02-15T12:28:49Z,My XR has 128GB. 5 years ago that seemed like a sensible minimum.
2025-02-14T21:58:04Z,"64GB has seemed to be fine for most of my users, just need a way around the iCloud free storage to back them up.

Why are people downvoting my personal experience managing hundreds of SEs? Lol"
2025-02-14T20:10:49Z,All we can do is 32 GB. take it or leave it.
2025-02-14T21:06:10Z,"nice, 32 gigs of ram üòÄ"
2025-02-14T20:55:19Z,"And that just killed any major hype for the device, if true, imo. 64GB is UNACCEPTABLE in 2025. Just like 8GB of RAM (in Macs)."
2025-02-14T21:36:26Z,"It‚Äôs a $500, decently spec‚Äôd iPhone. It was always going to have a catch."
2025-02-15T02:52:10Z,"It‚Äôs an SE, the catch is you get an outdated camera and no ProMotion. There doesn‚Äôt need to be any more catches."
2025-02-15T00:15:01Z,"It was never going to be a $500 phone, that's just wishful thinking."
2025-02-14T22:13:55Z,8GB RAM is not enough in a phone ‚Äì what are you doing on your phone dude xD
2025-02-14T22:17:49Z,I was referring to in Macs.
2025-02-15T13:03:51Z,"Actually, anything under 256gb is unacceptable. And considering it cost less than 2 coffees for Apple to upgrade, no one should buy this POS if it's 64gb. It's not 2008."

2025-02-14T20:55:59Z,"This is literally the exact same tactic that Apple uses to differentiate between the iPad Air and Pro pricing, it‚Äôs called a pricing ladder."
2025-02-15T02:31:17Z,IPad Air starts at 128 GB tho
2025-02-15T04:58:40Z,iPad Air isn‚Äôt the entry level iPad
2025-02-14T22:28:32Z,This subreddit is basically r/applerumors
2025-02-15T17:09:26Z,What else is there to talk about anymore?
2025-02-17T00:38:21Z,"Generally I agree with you, there's a lot more to talk about when it comes to rumors because release windows are few and far between, but I guess to spitball on some ideas...

* Coverage/reviews of third party apps (MacOS, iOS, iPadOS all included)
* Coverage/reviews/comparison breakdowns of non-Apple products specifically seeking to compete with Apple
* Coverage/reviews/comparison between Apple ecosystem *versions* of apps versus their Windows/Android counterparts, e.g. breakdowns on what new or different features are available on one side of the equation but not others
* Reviews of third party accessories and projects like cases, watch bands, custom mounts, keyboards and mice, etc. 
* ""Battlestation""/set-up pics
* How-to guides on power user features
* History/anniversary discussions

I generally see the anniversary posts but none of the rest of this stuff. Maybe it's against sub rules, I'd have to double check, but this stuff seems like the obvious gap."
2025-02-17T00:48:00Z,"Talking about apps is only really allowed on sundays because of the no self promotion rule, even if it‚Äôs not your app how are you meant to prove you‚Äôre not the developers alt account self promoting.

A lot of the ‚Äúapple vs alternative‚Äù type posts are done within a week or two of a product launching, after that you‚Äôd just be rehashing the same topic and repeating what‚Äôs already been said, and that goes for hardware and software.

You do see reviews of third party products occasionally, but unfortunately there‚Äôs just not much launching that‚Äôs particularly worth discussing. There‚Äôs only so many posts you can make about phone cases and magsafe stands.

You‚Äôre definitely right about the lack of battlestation pics, those would be a nice addition"
2025-02-15T00:14:14Z,64gb starting is so greedy of them
2025-02-15T05:18:37Z,I‚Äôm at 53/64 on my SE. My music and photos are all in the cloud. Some apps take up a lot of storage on the phone. I‚Äôd want at least 128 on my next phone.

2025-02-15T04:20:04Z,"It should be 128GB standard as the base minimum storage by now. But knowing Apple, it would take another five years before this become the bare minimum storage - meanwhile you must pay the storage tax!"
2025-02-15T06:13:49Z,"64GB is absurd. I paid ¬£98 for my Samsung A15, which has 128GB of storage"

2025-02-14T20:18:04Z,"I sincerely enjoy watching Apple's hubris around memory and storage upgrades blow up in their face.  Hopefully we're about to move past this as a strategic tool to pad their profits.

I can't tell what would be more iconic, a 64GB storage iPhone in 2025 when handheld PCs not much bigger than that are packing 64GB of RAM, or the refurb Mac Mini with 16GB *Default* being cheaper than the refurb M2 Mac Mini with 16GB *Upgrade*, \**chefs kiss*\*."

2025-02-15T02:34:25Z,"The longer Apple continues to think they can over price storage, the more their position will worsen.  It's been a running job for far too long.  Not funny anymore, Apple."
2025-02-14T21:26:39Z,"It‚Äôs hard to imagine what they even gain on that. The prices should be so low regardless 64 or 128 GB today. I wonder if it has more to do with forcing people into other models if they have anything but the most basic needs, rather than too bad profit margins‚Ä¶"
2025-02-14T21:29:23Z,Thought it was gonna be 512gb base with that title... Nope
2025-02-14T23:55:35Z,"I don‚Äôt doubt it. Just means that Samsung and others are making them squirm. ¬†

2025-02-15T02:38:35Z,"Will it be called the 16E?  It looks to be a huge leap from the SE 2.  If that's their logic, this thing may come in higher than $499.  Not worth it beyond that price."
2025-02-16T03:21:45Z,I hope they introduce a 512GB model. Was disappointed that the SE3 didn‚Äôt have a 512GB
2025-02-20T02:01:45Z,Well. Lol
2025-02-14T21:45:45Z,"People here are being outraged by it even though they were not going to buy it anyway and also they are not the target demographic.¬†

2025-02-15T09:47:13Z,"I was really intending to buy this device when it comes out, and that was despite 60 Hz and single camera. In an era where 256 should be the bare minimum, if this thing gets released with 64, it's over for me. Fuck the corporate greed so hard.

2025-02-15T00:10:47Z,"My usage is around 70gb / 50gb (on android / iPhone), but I always buy 256gb model just in case.

2025-02-15T05:01:05Z,"You literally described yourself as someone who can probably get by on 64GB lol

Store your photos in the cloud and stream all your music. 

After that unless you‚Äôre storing files locally on your phone what do you expect the average user to do with 256gb of storage?"
2025-02-15T05:50:56Z,"&gt; You literally described yourself as someone who can probably get by on 64GB lol

You're forgetting that iOS and system data, as well as Apple Intelligence, takes up a significant amount on their own.

&gt; Store your photos in the cloud and stream all your music.

Consumers shouldn't need to adjust their behaviour to cater to a company being cheap.

&gt; After that unless you‚Äôre storing files locally on your phone what do you expect the average user to do with 256gb of storage?

Not need to continually manage their storage? I don't even understand how anyone can argue in favour of Apple in this scenario."
2025-02-15T04:08:51Z,"Oh a ridiculous amount, is it? I thought it was going to be a ginormous amount, so I am disappointed"
2025-02-16T13:47:30Z,It‚Äôs an iPhone SE. Not sure what everyone is expecting here. It‚Äôs for people who use or want to use an iPhone but don‚Äôt need all the extras.

2025-02-15T01:15:58Z,Maaaybe with a few languages missing. No biggie.
2025-02-15T16:50:50Z,"On the one hand: I'm okay with them taking the time to get things right.

On the other hand, if it's buggy and not working well because of reasons fundamental to LLMs (even OpenAI has struggled with the Operator, it seems), then I don't think it'll be properly ready for the next few years.   
  
The caveat being that the new Siri features are supposed to work with Intents from developers and their own apps - and start with just their own apps. It should be an easier lift than actually clicking on a browser the way Operator does, and Claude's Computer Use framework, etc. So if we're at this stage and it's still not working, ooof, that just does not bode well."
2025-02-15T03:15:32Z,Good. Don‚Äôt release half baked shit
2025-02-15T20:22:20Z,Too late
2025-02-15T20:35:20Z,"None of this app intents stuff has rolled out yet.

(Notable exception of notification summaries which are horrific)"
2025-02-17T21:22:38Z,"Image playground looks horrible compared to any other image generator, like stuff you‚Äôd see near the start of the AI boom."
2025-02-17T21:50:25Z,"It still works to generate images as advertised. 

The originally demoed images look just as horrible as the ones we can generate ourselves now"
2025-02-17T22:56:39Z,Working and working well are two different things.
2025-02-18T00:41:36Z,It works as originally advertised though no?
2025-02-18T01:29:08Z,"Apple charges a premium and touts quality, I expect premium quality software not the bare minimum.

They were also using these features as a huge selling point then delayed them to ‚Äúget them right‚Äù and we get them and they‚Äôre almost 4-5 years behind the competition. 

You may just have low standards."
2025-02-18T01:45:25Z,"Image playground looks like shit. 

But it‚Äôs the same looking shit they showed off at WWDC. 

They have delivered the promised software. 

If you had different expectations then that‚Äôs on you. 

Image playground was delayed???"
2025-02-18T14:45:36Z,"Everything was delayed what are you even trying to get at? Image playground was released in December to everyone. Four months after the launch. 

Literally nothing AI related was ready at launch."
2025-02-18T13:36:00Z,That‚Äôs because Image Playground is entirely on device and any other image generator is sending your data to the cloud. That‚Äôs an extremely important difference.
2025-02-15T21:26:22Z,They already did‚Äîsee iPhone 16‚Äìit‚Äôs a half baked phone with promise of Apple AI.

2025-02-15T17:17:59Z,"Been saying this from day one, iOS 18 wasn‚Äôt the AI release from Apple, it was always intended to be iOS 19, but the market forced them to accelerate the timeline. Everything we‚Äôve got so far ‚Äì other than the privacy stuff ‚Äì has been table stakes for AI features. 

Intents and Personal Context are the interesting differentiators and when they finally launch they‚Äôll be closer WWDC 2025 and quite possibly the iPhone 17 than the iPhone 16 which will be six months old in under a month."
2025-02-15T21:32:00Z,"Everyone‚Äôs been saying this since day one.

Stop listening to Mark Gurman. He and Bloomberg are literally paid to manipulate the stock market.¬†

https://daringfireball.net/2023/07/apple_gpt_bloomberg"
2025-02-14T22:41:16Z,He claimed they were going to announce something soon and then the day after they put out a teaser for next week.

2025-02-14T22:31:14Z,"Even if he‚Äôs right a majority of the time, why have so many started believing everything he says, all the time?"
2025-02-15T04:39:51Z,"Because he‚Äôs right the majority of the time. 

You answered your own question"
2025-02-14T22:33:00Z,"Agreed, and That‚Äôs the thing: he isn‚Äôt even right a majority of the time. People just forget the times he‚Äôs wrong and no one says anything about it and he sure as hell never says he‚Äôs wrong lol"
2025-02-14T23:14:06Z,"&gt;That‚Äôs the thing: he isn‚Äôt even right a majority of the time.

No, he is actually correct most of the time, as shown by AppleTrack's [leaderboard](https://appletrack.com/leaderboard/).

Gurman's accuracy was 86.5% from 2020‚Äì2022, the tracker doesn't give partial credit, and I have little reason to believe that he's gotten much worse since then.

Those who incorrectly believe that sources like Gurman, Kuo, Young, and MacRumors's own sources are unreliable *always* make one or more of the following mistakes:

1. Cherry-picking
2. Misremembering rumors
3. Not keeping track of the rumor's source

Regarding Apple analysts: The more information‚Äîeven if imperfect‚Äîthat we have about future Apple products, the less analysis we need. I believe that's why analysts like John Gruber and Neil Cybart constantly try to bring down the Apple community's opinion on the rumor mill. If they convince people that rumor sites X, Y, and Z are not to be trusted, then those people will spend more time reading/following *them* instead."
2025-02-19T21:16:20Z,"The way this sub hates leakers is baffling. It‚Äôs the only reason we have an idea of what‚Äôs in the pipeline. Apple would prefer us to be 100% in the dark. Then Apple‚Äôs keynotes are met with a ‚Äúyawn‚Äù in here because folks have already known Apple‚Äôs plans for years, that info doesn‚Äôt come out of thin air lol"

Your ‚Äúchart‚Äù also doesn‚Äôt account for the latter half of my comment, where his ‚Äúcoverage‚Äù is influenced by Bloomberg‚Äôs constant pressure to create ‚Äúmarket moving news,‚Äù which incentivizes dramatizing positive and negative news.

I‚Äôll DM you the link if you want for this, lol. They are time stamped with links to his newsletter claims, and if they occurred during WWDC, I checked them off.

As for the second part, yeah, I mean I guess that‚Äôs true, but it does not really matter for me, personally. The articles are pretty sensationalist some times but I‚Äôll read the articles if it has something to do with the new OS‚Äôs, and if not, then I won‚Äôt read them."

Again, as for your note taking on it, it‚Äôs still meaningless to me. When were the claims made? Was it what he said a day before the event? 3 weeks before? Does it take into account stuff he said about rumors he didn‚Äôt push out but others did, what he said regarding that, etc?

The amount of people around the world with active devices know the word ‚ÄúSiri‚Äù just like they know the word ‚ÄúGoogle‚Äù. No way they‚Äôre going to nix the branding even if the new Siri is a completely different product. 

And Siri‚Äôs been getting worse because they‚Äôre prob not working on the engine beneath the one that‚Äôs available currently. 

I could be wrong, but let‚Äôs hope Apple can walk &amp; chew gum at the same time with their billions in cash flow. Its success depends on whether senior level executives designate their priorities &amp; funds appropriately, and I agree ‚Äî I‚Äôm not hopeful. But the moniker Siri is probably never going away."
2025-02-14T23:42:58Z,Actually witnessing the unstoppable force (Siri being dogshit) vs immovable object (working examples shown at wwdc) playing out in real time.
2025-02-15T04:43:37Z,"Have they actually done a real life demo of this stuff at all?

The stuff they showed during the wwdc keynote was not an actual demo. It was like a proof of concept video with real UI and graphics. But obviously none of the work under the hood was anywhere close to finished"
2025-02-15T04:44:52Z,"Yeah no it was not real time or show outside the keynote at all, it‚Äôs just because it‚Äôs fucking Apple showing tangible, cut out, repeatable scenarios at WWDC that I thought it would be unheard of for them to not deliver (immovable object)."
2025-02-15T20:20:28Z,This happened with visionOS too. Some features were removed from the final release and some UI elements were completely redesigned before the final release. The removed features were edited out of the original video and the redesigned ones remain inaccurately displayed¬†
2025-02-14T22:23:45Z,"So would you rather hear people complaining that it's delayed, or would you rather hearing them complain that it's disappointing and doesn't work as advertised? Those are the options. Either way, get ready for the complaining."
2025-02-14T22:53:45Z,I would already be happy if Siri wouldn‚Äòt get incrementally worse.
2025-02-14T22:44:00Z,I‚Äôve been in or partly in the Apple ecosystem for nearly 20 years. The complaining never ever ends.
2025-02-15T14:09:55Z,And Siri has been the longest lasting in that cycle.
2025-02-15T00:05:13Z,"Reddit: Apple intelligence sucks; Apple should have waited 

Apple: okay we‚Äôll wait

Reddit: how dare Apple delay the release?!?!?"
2025-02-18T17:55:25Z,"The problem is it's both.

Everything they've been doing lately is both shit AND late."
2025-02-15T15:48:34Z,Then Apple should release things when they are ready.
2025-02-15T04:40:58Z,"lol, we all know it‚Äôs gonna be both in the end. 

I‚Äôm excited for the app intents upgrade but also have no doubt at all it‚Äôs gonna be somewhere between buggy and non functional."
2025-02-18T17:55:42Z,Exactly.
2025-02-15T19:12:02Z,"I don't even think those are two different options at this point. It's going to end up being both late and disappointing. 

Apple are too far behind at this point to likely ever catch up, and their company philosophy around user data will ensure this."
2025-02-18T03:36:02Z,It's Apple's fault for announcing a feature that's not ready yet.
2025-02-15T15:47:02Z,"Shocking! 

Who in their right mind didn't see this inevitability on the horizon? You don't need Gurman or a crystal ball to see this. Judge over the 13 years how well Apple understands AI. (For 11 years they didn't care. Now they care but haven't got a clue where to start.)"
2025-02-16T00:17:14Z,Apples been a pioneer in machine learning before it was ever re-dubbed ‚ÄúAI‚Äù. Hell even AI isn‚Äôt true AI. What they were ignorant of was developing LLMs perhaps using their machine learning knowledge. Now they‚Äôre racing to put together an UI ready LLM because somehow they didn‚Äôt see OpenAI coming.
2025-02-16T07:45:04Z,"&gt; What they were ignorant of was developing LLMs perhaps using their machine learning knowledge. Now they‚Äôre racing to put together an UI ready LLM because somehow they didn‚Äôt see OpenAI coming.

We wholeheartedly agree on this."
2025-02-18T03:37:19Z,"Prime example of ""resting on their laurels"""
2025-02-14T22:30:01Z,"""Looks at source of article\*

\*Doesn't bother clicking the link.\*"
2025-02-15T02:54:07Z,Gurman had a 97% accurate WWDC record last year.
2025-02-15T00:03:53Z,"First was crypto, then nft, now ai. Sell it to softbank, but i am fed up!"
2025-02-15T21:25:56Z,Apple is saving it for iPhone 17 selling point (I‚Äôm such a sucker for buying the 16).
2025-02-16T07:21:45Z,"iPhone 17: We have actual Apple Intelligence, and we think you gonna love it"
2025-02-17T23:36:19Z,"I love how it‚Äôs a Siri overhaul but it‚Äôs only for new phones, so essentially they‚Äôll never actually *fix* Siri."
2025-02-14T22:22:31Z,Thank you for the gift
2025-02-14T23:20:40Z,"Shocker. Who didn‚Äôt see this coming?

So happy I bought the first phone built for Apple Intelligence. It‚Äôs junk."
2025-02-14T23:49:38Z,"I have an ip13pro and I almost fell for the ai 16pro bull, glad I didn‚Äôt¬†"
2025-02-15T15:59:08Z,Siri was probably telling people to hurt themselves.
2025-02-18T03:33:41Z,So the fix itself has bugs?
2025-02-18T03:47:14Z,"Don‚Äôt overhaul Siri with AI, she‚Äôs bad enough already."
2025-02-19T19:19:57Z,"I hate reading these comments

If apple released it half baked, and unfinished, the common complaint would be ""This is garbage, they should have spent more time fixing it before releasing a half baked product, I miss the OLD apple"" 

And now with the delays you have people basically saying shit like ""This is so annoying, I wish they would just release it half baked so that we can test it and it can get better over time, instead of delaying it JUST IN TIME FOR THE NEXT IPHONE, GREEDY BASTARDS!!!"" 

What do you people want?"
2025-02-15T01:37:12Z,It‚Äôs crazy how bad Siri is. Apple is viewed as an elite brand and Siri is such dog water I‚Äôd be embarrassed if I put a product out that bad. Perfect example the other day I was looking at a website with calendar info on it. I ask Siri to add the calendar event to my phone and it doesn‚Äôt know what to do.‚Ä¶
2025-02-14T23:16:55Z,"I don't like the new siri UI. I feel like you used to be able to see past siri requests, but now you can't. It also feels easier to accidentally dismiss."
2025-02-15T00:00:52Z,You‚Äôve never been able to do that.
2025-02-15T02:57:08Z,You could until iOS 15.
2025-02-15T00:44:10Z,"Pretty sure you‚Äôve been able to scroll up and see past requests before, yeah. I‚Äôm not saying complete history, but at least from the past day. 

Maybe I truly don‚Äôt use Siri enough to notice how long ago they got rid of it, but it would‚Äôve been nice to still see the siri request from seconds ago that I accidentally dismissed."
2025-02-15T02:58:01Z,You're right. iOS 14 and earlier allowed you to view Siri history.
2025-02-15T04:44:02Z,What? Where?
2025-02-15T13:18:03Z,"When Siri was open, you could pull down from the top of the screen to see the history."
2025-02-15T01:24:45Z,Siri is just rubbish.
2025-02-15T04:44:53Z,"If you can‚Äôt use Siri to basic things like set timers, send texts pause music etc etc. 

That‚Äôs might be more a you problem than a Siri problem"
2025-02-15T22:55:16Z,"I get that people want some sort of supercomputer to do their bidding, and I don‚Äôt really care about using my voice that much - but Siri does work fine for me. I don‚Äôt think Alexa or Google Home much better, the biggest problem I have is that it‚Äôs useless for non-Apple home stuff. But I could fix that if I put some effort in"
2025-02-18T17:50:56Z,"Me: Siri, set a timer for 15 minutes. 
Siri: ‚Äî(long pause)
Siri: Sorry, I‚Äôm having problems. 
Siri: ‚Äî(long pause)
Siri: Try again later. 

Me: Siri, what‚Äôs the temperature?
Siri: Sorry, I need to know your location first. 
Me: Siri, what‚Äôs the temperature?
Siri: it‚Äôs 6 degrees out. 

Me: Siri, what‚Äôs my battery percentage?
Siri: Sorry, I don‚Äôt have access to that. 

Simple requests? Yeah, thanks for the dumbass comment."
2025-02-14T22:37:20Z,Beyond a joke this now. I‚Äôm so fed up with Apple and feel like a fucking mug buying their shite every year;(
