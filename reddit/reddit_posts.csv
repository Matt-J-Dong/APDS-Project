1iwfcd0,apple,I built an iOS app for checking gas &amp; EV charging prices via CarPlay ‚Äì OctaneBuddy,"Hey r/apple,

I wanted a way to check gas prices while driving via CarPlay, but I was surprised that no app offered this. Since I drive a car that requires premium and a full tank is over 50L, even saving a few cents per litre adds up quickly. So, I decided to dive into iOS development and build my own solution‚ÄîOctaneBuddy (https://apps.apple.com/us/app/octanebuddy/id6738063165).

What started as a personal project is now on the App Store (**with no ads, no data collection, and no subscription**‚ÄîI originally built it just for myself). Since launching, I‚Äôve been adding features based on user feedback, including:

‚úÖ Gas price support for the **US, Canada, UK, and now Germany**! üá©üá™ (With **Australia &amp; Austria** coming soon)

‚úÖ EV charging station support (mostly tested in the US &amp; Canada, but should work worldwide!)

‚úÖ Support for **Diesel**, **E85**, and more fuel types

I‚Äôm planning to work on a widget next and will also be refining the UI based on feedback. If you install the app, I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts! There‚Äôs a ‚ÄúContact me‚Äù button in the app for direct feedback, and if you spot any bugs, I‚Äôll fix them ASAP.

Let me know if you‚Äôd like to TestFlight beta releases before they go live! This is my first ever app and I‚Äôm new to Swift so bear with me :) I‚Äôd like to make more apps so if you have ideas for a ‚Äúsimple‚Äù app that doesn‚Äôt exist or isn‚Äôt done well and would benefit many, lmk!

Thanks, and happy driving! üöó‚õΩ‚ö°

Edit: if you'd like to TestFlight, I'd be happy to add you! Please hit the ""contact me"" button in the app or send an email to [sid@siddharthnatamai.com](mailto:sid@siddharthnatamai.com) so I can add your email to the TestFlight group. Thank you!!

Edit 2: Also gonna seriously look into CloudKit and make a proof of concept app where users can snap a pic of the gas station pump and feed prices into a database for other users to view. Maybe it can be turned into a mini game of sorts :)

Edit 3: Widgets and initial install/launch bug fixed and on the way to TestFlight users and App Store soon (hopefully by tomorrow). This will be version 1.5.5",0.79,82,0,82,1740371901.0,[],,88,Promo Sunday,1740331609.0,2025-02-23T17:26:49Z

1iw8yi7,apple,"I made an app to help you tackle habits more easily through Habit Stacking (NO Ads, Privacy Focused)","Hello everyone! I‚Äôd like to share a bit of a story around how I launched my very first iOS app. At the middle of last year, I was obsessed with productivity systems and scrolling productivity subreddits in the hopes that I would finally find something that would fix my life. This is when I stumbled on the concept of habit stacking - the idea of linking new habits to existing ones. I started small: after pouring my morning coffee, I would write the three tasks I needed to get done for the day. After brushing my teeth, I would meditate for five minutes.

I needed a way to keep track of the growing sequential habits but none of the apps I found on the Appstore really captured the way how habits naturally flowed together - so I spent my weekends and hours after work since developing Chayn using SwiftUI. It was a steep learning curve but finally ‚Äúfinishing‚Äù (if there is any such thing) and hitting publish made it all worth it. It‚Äôs [now available to download on the app store.](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/chayn-stack-habits/id6741157498)

**Key Features:**

* Ability to stack habits (both in sequence and in parallel)
* Track your moods
* Keep track of total time spent on habits + streaks
* Customise each habit and habit stack to your liking
* Make your habits as detailed or as simple as you want

In this video, I‚Äôll break down how the C1 modem works, why it matters, and what it means for the future of Apple‚Äôs ecosystem. From improved power efficiency and seamless A18 processor integration to potential future advancements like millimeter-wave 5G, the C1 is Apple‚Äôs first step in total modem independence.

I‚Äôm a software developer who has been caring for pets for over 12 years, helping over 30 cats and dogs. While it‚Äôs been incredibly rewarding, staying on top of everything‚Äîvaccinations, medications, new symptoms, and emerging problems‚Äîhas always been a challenge. Life gets busy, and things can slip through the cracks, sometimes leading to preventable health issues.

Over the years, I searched for a tool that could help me log almost everything about my pets and provide actionable insights to make better care decisions‚Äîbut I couldn‚Äôt find one that fully met my needs.

1iwdiy9,apple,"I launched Finma, an AI based auto-expense tracker app for iPhone ($100 Giveaway Inside)","Hello Guys!

I released an expense tracker app called [Finma](https://finma.money) last week. There are 1000s of expense tracker apps, so why did I make another one? I'll explain in a few points why I made it and what differentiates it from others: 

**Why did I build this?**  
\- I live in India and wanted an app that could track all my bank accounts and credit cards in one place, *automatically*!  
\- Automatic tracking was the key here, I'm lazy and hate manual expense entries.  
\- Started building Finma around 2 years ago, there were 0 apps that supported auto-expense tracking for credit cards and bank accounts in India on iOS.

**How does auto-expense tracking work?**  
\- Finma directly connects to your email, searches for transaction alerts and statements sent by your bank and automatically creates transactions entries.  
\- A rules features allows you to create keyword based rules and auto-tag transaction based on your usage.  
\- To ensure 100% accuracy, I have built-in support for most Indian banks. Post launch, thanks to users I'm slowing adding custom PDF parsing support for more International banks.

**Where does AI come in the picture?**  
\- For statements that I haven't added custom support, I use OpenAI or Google Gemini to extract transactions from PDFs.  
\- Automatic category suggestions  
\- Some other areas where AI is used is automatic transaction extraction from bank email alerts, helping with regex, etc.

**Privacy**  
\- Built with privacy in mind, I do not store any financial data on any server. All user data is stored locally on-device.  
\- I try my best to process PDFs and emails locally.  
\- Any data that does get sent over to AI services is anonymous and is not linked to the user.

**Future Plans**  
\- Working on adding Plaid/Teller and GoCardless support for direct bank integration. 

\---

**Giveaway:**  
I'm giving away 4 promo codes for 1 year subscription worth a total of $100 ($25/yr sub). All you got to do is check out the app and give me some feedback -- both good and especially bad feedback are appreciated as I really want to fix the pain points first.

1iw6k30,apple,I've built an app that translates your Apple Watch health data!,"Hey everyone!

Meet Livity! It's a health tracker that uses your Apple Watch data to show you stuff like sleep patterns, body recovery, and how hard you're pushing yourself during the day.

The big thing for me was privacy - I'm tired of apps that want to upload everything to their servers. This one does everything right on your phone. No accounts, no cloud stuff, just your data staying on your device where it belongs.

Main features:

\* Sleep tracking &amp; analysis  
\* Recovery tracking  
\* Daily strain monitoring  
\* Battery-style energy level  
\* Stress alerts when you need to take a breather

There is our Reddit community r/LivityApp where everyone can join and suggest new features / complain about the bugs (I always do my best to fix those, as Livity just became my full-time job!)

If you're into health tracking but don't want your data floating around somewhere, check it out:¬†  
[https://apps.apple.com/us/app/livity-sleep-health-tracker/id6498938838](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/livity-sleep-health-tracker/id6498938838)

Most of you hate paid apps so I will go straight to the point.  
The first overview screen is free for everyone where you can take a quick look at your day stats.   
More detailed data is behind the paywall.¬†
