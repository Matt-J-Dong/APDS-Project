1ix366p,meisz2t,t3_1ix366p,ControlCAD,"&gt;Sir Jony Ive, the innovative designer of Apple’s iMac, iPhone and Apple Watch, and a close friend and ­collaborator of the late Steve Jobs, says he still often asks himself: “I wonder what Steve would do?”

&gt;Ive told BBC Radio 4’s Desert Island Discs on Sunday that he does so despite the fact that Jobs had specifically told him not to before his death in 2011, aged 56.

&gt;“He used to say I really don’t want you to be thinking ‘Well, what would Steve do?’,” Ives said.

&gt;The designer, who was born in Chingford, Essex, and moved to San Francisco to work at Apple in 1992, worked alongside the company’s ­co-founder and CEO five years later, when Jobs was called back in to help the struggling company after a period working elsewhere.

&gt;Jobs’ return marked an immediate improvement for Ive, he recalled. “It was remarkable that, despite the limitations of my ability to communicate, Steve understood what I thought and how I felt,” Ive said.

&gt;He told host Lauren Laverne that he feels Jobs’ reputation as demanding and ruthless is unfair: “If you have such a clear, pure view of ­creating something new … if you are serious about actually wanting to develop and make it, you can’t just say ‘well, here’s an idea’ because if that’s how you’re going to behave, it will remain an idea.”

&gt;He added that he couldn’t read anything about Jobs for 10 years after his death.

&gt;The designer, who grew up in Staffordshire, bemoaned the lack of understanding about art and design in many schools and recalled how he felt his intelligence was questioned by teachers because he was shy and wanted to spend time making things.

&gt;Fears that the technology he has helped to create could now be interfering with human creativity worry Ive, he said, adding that he finds it difficult to monitor his own use of technology. While he praised all the benefits that have flowed from the arrival of the iPhone, he said he feels a responsibility for the unintended, negative aspects. This is in his mind when he makes decisions about the tech of the future, he added.

&gt;Ive’s concern about the threat posed by AI is mixed with his excitement about its possibilities, he said. His main worry is the unchecked speed of development. “We need time to understand and react,” he said. He did not give details of the AI project he spoke about working on last autumn with OpenAI CEO, Sam Altman, but is enthusiastic: “It’s probably the first time in my career that I’m inspired by capability in this way.”",13,0,13,False,[],0,1740407326.0,0,2025-02-24T14:28:46Z

1ix2yxw,meiqlq7,t3_1ix2yxw,chrisdh79,"From the article: Apple plans to launch a second-generation AirTag in May or June this year, according to a post today from a leaker known as [Kosutami](https://x.com/Kosutami_Ito/status/1893941895761444872).

Bloomberg's Mark Gurman previously reported that a new AirTag would be released in mid-2025. May or June would align with that timeframe.

Below, we recap three new features rumored for the AirTag 2:

* With a second-generation Ultra Wideband chip, the AirTag 2 is expected to have up to 3× longer range compared to the current AirTag. The chip debuted in the iPhone 15 and the Apple Watch Ultra 2. On the iPhone 15 and iPhone 16 models, there is a Precision Finding for People feature that can help you to find your friends in crowded places, and it offers a range of up to 200 feet/60 meters.
* The new AirTag's built-in speaker is expected to be more difficult to remove or tamper with, as an anti-stalking safety measure.
* The new AirTag is rumored to have improved integration with the Apple Vision Pro.

The original AirTag was announced during an Apple Event in April 2021. In the U.S., an individual AirTag costs $29, and a set of four costs $99.

Kosutami is best known as a collector of prototype Apple products, but they have occasionally shared accurate information about Apple's future plans. For example, they accurately revealed that the iPhone 16 Pro would be equipped with a metal-enclosed battery many months before the device launched. However, their August 2024 claim that new AirPods Pro would be coming ""soon"" did not pan out, as AirPods Pro 3 have yet to launch.

In another post today, Kosutami seems to be once again implying that new AirPods Pro are on the horizon, along with new Apple smart home accessories. Apple is expected to unveil an all-new smart home hub this year, and it is also rumored to be working on a Face ID doorbell and a smart home camera for release in 2026 or later.",223,0,223,False,[],0,1740406521.0,0,2025-02-24T14:15:21Z

&gt; In 2021, weeks after Biden’s inauguration, Apple said it would invest $430 billion in the United States over five years and create 20,000 new jobs, including construction of a new campus in North Carolina, which has reportedly been paused. And in January 2018, Apple said it would invest $350 billion in the United States over five years and create 20,000 jobs, including by growing US data center capacity.


&gt; Apple did not immediately respond to a question about whether any of the promised investment dollars or new jobs announced Monday had also been included in prior announcements.


It's mostly BS numbers to placate Trump so that he can jerk off on his shitty social media site.


&gt; Trump thanked Cook and Apple for the announcement in an all-caps post on Truth Social early Monday, in which he took credit for the decision.

&gt; “The reason, faith in what we are doing, without witch (sic), they wouldn’t be investing ten cents,” he said.


&gt; White House trade counselor Peter Navarro wouldn’t rule out a tariff exemption for Apple on iPhone and other electronics imports from China, when asked by CNN on Monday.


&gt; “That’s always President Trump’s decision,” he said in an appearance on CNN News Central. Asked if he would support such an exemption, he refused to voice an opinion.

I frequently use my iPhone, mounted on top of a proper video camera as a b cam shooting a basic wide shot. 

By shooting in log im able to get the two cameras to match properly. 

It really is amazing to have such a high end image coming off such a small device. 

For my money there are two key areas that Apple can improve to make the iPhone a better professional video tool

1. Either add a variable aperture lens or some sort of electronic ND. 

Bottom line is, we need to be able to shoot with a 180 degree shutter. 

The fixed f1.7 aperture lens is no good for video. An iPhone lens that could go from f1.7 to f16 or lower would be an instant upgrade for me

2. It’s such a darn pain getting files off the iPhone. 

While the Pro iPhones now get usb3 transfer speeds, in practice. This just isn’t the case. Transferring files off the iPhone, via a wire, within that weird finder view is both painful and extremely slow. 

Beyond that some open gate recording modes so we can capture the entire sensor would be welcome.

Samsung et al have benefitted from Qualcomm’s chip being all-in-one, which boosts performance and power efficiency. So the fact that Apple has been outclassing Android phones many times on battery life despite that major disadvantage goes to show they know what they’re doing, and the recent boost of 5 hours from 16 hours to 21 hours of video streaming from the 14 to 16e shows Apple can increase battery life with their modem.

I’m very excited for the future of C chips, and that they will improve no matter good, bad, or otherwise in successive generations

Eventually Steve convinced them that staring in commercials (those dancing iPod once with silhouettes) would be good for them and give them more exposure for their then new record, ""How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb"" and it DID work. iPod commercials up to that point did not feature artists and only features random shadows dancing on like splatter paint artwork to a song, the artists themselves were never featured.

Today you have $400 Android phones that are significantly more capable than whatever you had in 2016 at that price point.

In some other regions, like in Europe, the price makes even less sense. It costs the same as an S24 Ultra when you match the ssd capacity (or $100 less if you don't).

So no, it's not a budget anymore even if it's within inflation, because on the market you have a ton of alternatives for that price or lower.

That's not true.  Mirror Worlds LLC sued Apple for the interfaces in Cover Flow, Time Machine and Spotlight and won $625 million in damages in 2010.  However, that was overturned in 2011

Apple continued to offer Cover Flow on the iPhone until iOS 8 (2014) and the Mac until Mojave (2018) and continues to use interface features it was sued for elsewhere.

They phased out Cover Flow mostly because, well... it sucked.  It was extremely flashy and was great for demos, but as libraries got larger and displays did to, it was just really inefficient, both from a user perspective and from the resources necessary to display.

Still IMHO, I'd like to see Apple Music do *something* in horizontal mode, ideally giving it feature parity with the desktop app.

I could make EV mode free if you think that's best (and you're welcome to request a refund). I can also add you to the TestFlight group which gives you access to the app for free.

**Desert Island Discs, Sir Jony Ive, Designer**

&gt; Sir Jony Ive is a designer who is best known for his pioneering work at Apple alongside his friend and colleague, the late Steve Jobs. Jony’s creative vision is behind some of the company’s seminal products which have transformed the way we live today including phones, music players and watches.  

&gt; He was born in Chingford in east London and loved drawing and spending time in his father’s workshop where the two of them made the young Jony’s Christmas presents including a go-kart, a treehouse and a toboggan.  

&gt; He studied Industrial Design at Newcastle Polytechnic and moved to San Francisco to work for Apple in 1992. In 1997 Steve Jobs returned to the company, having been ousted several years earlier, and the two of them set about revolutionising the landscape for home computers with the creation of the iMac.  

&gt; In 2019 Jony set up his own company LoveFrom with the industrial designer Marc Newson. In 2023 Jony and his team designed a foldable Red Nose for Comic Relief and in the same year the company launched a scholarship programme aimed at increasing representation in the design industry.  

&gt; In 2012 he was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire for services to design and enterprise.

1ivqlvi,me7qr0m,t3_1ivqlvi,ControlCAD,"&gt;Apple Original Films’ The Gorge has become the biggest film launch in the young streamer’s history. The Gorge eclipses numbers turned in by the Jon Watts-directed George Clooney-Brad Pitt-starrer Wolfs, which launched last fall, pivoting from a planned wide release to a small theatrical and global streaming release.

&gt;Apple does not divulge specific numbers, but the company confirms it is the biggest film premiere in Apple TV+ history, driving double-digit growth globally for the service and boosting new viewers by +80%, weekend over weekend, following its debut on Friday, February 14. This comes after Deadline revealed that Severance eclipsed Ted Lasso to become Apple TV+’s most viewed series in the history of the service.

Worse, *it is consistently more annoying to use than other pieces of technology.*

VR headsets may take time for some people to acclimate to in terms of motion sickness, force you to stare at screens at all times, have garbage battery life, block your awareness of the outside world and make you feel isolated unless pass through is on(and still make you seem checked out to others regardless), make you look dorky, mess with your hair and makeup, and are just generally less significantly comfortable for long periods of use(yes, even 'lightweight' ones.

The issue is that over on Linux, you’re using the same graphics cards that you do on Windows. As a result, a lot of the code that actually generates the UI for video games does not need to change when you change operating systems. But on a Mac, graphics are a different story, as Apple doesn’t actually support industry standard graphics APIs on macOS anymore.  (Linux *does* provide such support for M1 GPUs, so it’s not that it isn’t possible, it’s just that Apple is being deliberately difficult—later Apple Silicon processors are still under active development, and their drivers have not landed in the mainstream Linux kernel yet.) 

That all said, there are only three categories of people for whom the lack of games should be a reason to pass on a MacBook Air (because of the inherent compromises in gaming laptops):

1. College students
2. Frequent travelers
3. Budget-sensitive gamers who can only afford one computer

The reason I say this is because if you have a desktop rig, there *are* workarounds, especially for single-player games.  You *can* connect to your desktop rig from your Mac. If you’re on the same network, you’ll likely be fine to remote into your desktop rig and play that way.

First-gen Intel Macs were 32-bit Core Solo &amp; Duo processors, which did not support 64-bit processing and dropped OS support in two years while receiving few capabilities of the ""supported"" macOS upgrades.

First-gen iPhone was 2G, stopped major OS updates in 3 years.

First-gen AppleTV was an Intel-based system (could even be converted into a Mac mini) which was totally replaced with the A-series black box style. They provided limited support for services from it, but it was basically abandoned.

First-gen iPad dropped new OS support in two years. 

First-gen Apple Watch was later referred to as the ""Series Zero"" and received virtually no feature enhancements over time. Basically a dead product in a year, official OS support dropped in 3 years.

First-gen HomePod still works well, but they discontinued it, switching to the HomePod mini exclusively for a few years before adding it back to the lineup. This is a bit of a stretch, to be fair.

I recall the first-gen iPods didn't get the same updates as even the ""second release"" first-gen (10GB option), but I can't find evidence of that, so this may be my incorrect recollection.

One of his last major interviews at All Things D in 2010 was a lot about Apple, how it works, and what the future is about. It’s like an hour and half long, and some of it isn’t on that topic, but it’s worth watching.

I think it’s also telling how he viewed himself in the context of Apple’s success all the way in 2010. He wrote a note to himself (in email form) about how he views himself that no one saw. Especially today, with the exception of Apple and Tim Cook, I don’t see anyone in technology that thinks like that.

1iv7ozq,me3omz0,t1_me3nlvo,PeakBrave8235,"&gt;that teaming up with great collaborators is what can really make or break your success.

Absolutely! And Steve Jobs said that as much — that he is only one person, and that it’s the team effort that accomplishes things. He likened Apple to the Beatles, and he said that while all 4 were great musicians in their own, it was all of them together that equaled more than the sum of its parts. That, and constantly bumping up against one another to vigorously debate a topic to make sure what they were doing was actually good. 

There's a really great note (in email form) Steve Jobs wrote to himself on his iPad. It’s on the Steve Jobs Archive website. He never sent it to anyone, only himself. So it’s a very nice look into how he thought about himself in the context of Apple’s success. And especially today, with the exception of Apple and Tim Cook, I don’t see anyone in technology that thinks like that.

BUT as /u/Smith6612 points out, a bursty workload today turns into a sustained workload in future and lack of cooling dramatically limits the longevity of a device. As workloads increase over time, that ""peak before throttling"" gets shorter and shorter, and the ability to be ""fine"" with 30-50% reduced performance vanishes

The difference being that Intel doesn't need to care as much because they haven't formed their entire business around ""It's thin and light with a very long battery life"", whereas Apple is intrinsically linked to power consumption and portability. It's literally the main reason they created powerPC/IAM, the reason they left powerPC for Intel, and the reason they moved on from Intel to Apple Silicon

For me it comes down to ""I'd just get a Pro"", but I think Apple will hit a point before long where people start avoiding the Air because it proves not to have great longevity. Some will upgrade, of course, but some will go with other manufacturers entirely

1iv55oc,me5omo7,t1_me3sp20,m0rogfar,"Sustained workloads are generally ones where you click a button and then wait a while for the computer to do the thing. Rendering video would be a classic example.

The alternative is so-called burst workloads, where the user throws a task at the computer that is intensive, but only for a very short period of time, and afterwards, the computer can go back to doing nothing and cooling down. Some examples would be opening a complex application or even opening a webpage. Generally, anything where you click a button and then the computer is done with what you asked it to do within a few seconds is considered a burst workload. Burst workloads are generally far more common.

The MacBook Air can slow down during sustained loads that take more than 5-10 minutes. As a general rule of thumb, if you have a task where you make the computer do something, and then have to wait for the computer to finish for long enough that you know you can go prepare lunch or whatever before it’s done, that’s going to be faster on a MacBook Pro than a MacBook Air, even if both have the same chip.

Realistically, those types of workloads are often the ones that benefit the most from upgrading to a Pro or Max chip, so the comparison between the MacBook Air and the MacBook Pro with the base chip is somewhat silly. If this is a thing you regularly do, the M4 Pro MacBook Pro is so close in price to the M4 MacBook Pro that the upgrade is a no-brainer if you actually use the power, and if this is something you basically never do, but it happens one time, the fact that the MacBook Air will be slightly slower that time is basically irrelevant in the grand scheme of things.",5,0,5,False,[],0,1740229427.0,4,2025-02-22T13:03:47Z

They seem to have no indication in Apple TV+ about this.  My dad tries signing in with his Apple ID and gets a page asking him to start a free trial.  Something is not connecting.  I thought once connected via family, they sign in with THEIR Apple ID, not mine, correct?

My mom’s also doesn’t work.  But that may be because the original profile they were paying for is under her Apple ID.  I’m not sure how it would work seeing as she has not yet canceled her plan, but also should have the new one under me.  Luckily, she didn’t cancel her old one, so they still have that.  But I wonder if it would help to cancel?

Also I am wondering if it is an issue that I live in Canada and they live still in the US.  I guess I should have led with that, if that ends up being the problem.

(I looked for the PINNED POSTS to no avail)

I think if I could get through to someone at Apple, I might be able to solve this ...but.? My wife is the Apple person. She's had an iPhone6??? 11 years old or older. Amazingly it still works..or did until I went to Comcast. Since the newest Apple phone is coming out next week, we talked about buying one. But, (long explanation skipped) in the interim, I wanted her to TRY an extra Android phone we already owned. Comcast was supposed to simply switch the sim cards...but...after they finished that, the IP6 doesn't work anymore. Actually, it does work, but ""they don't support it anymore"". The phone actually does work, but won't connect to the WiFi or any phone lines. Wheeew.

To make things worse, when I try to get into her Apple photo account, Apple says That phone is no longer valid. I can get partially in, by using the ""extra"" phone number that was on the Android, but, then, Apple doesn't like the (proper) email address that my wife has always used in the past. So, I can't get into Apple to change the erroneous phone number, or anything else. To my surprise,m y wife's IPad still seems to work fine. Any ideas how I can get to someone at Apple who can help straighten this mess out?",2,0,2,False,[],0,1740345348.0,0,2025-02-23T21:15:48Z

The phone not being able to connect is interesting .. The iPad working fine sounds completely normal. I’m guessing when you disabled the phone, a bunch of legacy connections were turned off on your account and normal security was finally enabled. 

Photo account? You mean iCloud Photo Library? All those photos can be accessed by any other reasonably modern Apple device. If she had photos sync turned on then they are just sitting there waiting for her. 

Not being able to connect to Wi-Fi. Not being able to use your email address. This sounds like several problems at the same time. Reset network settings for the first one to work again. I’m not sure what to do about the login issue, you didn’t include enough information.

- Google prioritizes “unique” content, so while every recipe for chicken noodle soup or whatever will be pretty similar, the story before it is unique and that’s a plus in google’s eyes 

- Repeating keywords is a factor in ranking. If you want to rank highly for “best chicken soup” you’re going to want to repeat that phrase a few times. You can make it seem natural in a long blog post. 

- Speaking of which, length in general is a factor as well. A page with four lines of ingredients and instructions is going to seem bare to Google’s algorithm, and therefore less useful, which ranks it lower. 

- While many skip the story and go straight to the recipe, some will read it, which improves metrics such as time spent on page. And of course, ad views.

Here is what i sent:

&gt;I am writing to express my strong opposition to the Government’s plans to force Apple and other companies to weaken security on cloud storage services like iCloud. This is a serious threat to the privacy and security of millions of people, including your constituents.

&gt;The biggest issue with these proposals is that once a backdoor exists, it isn’t just the UK Government that can use it—anyone can. Cybercriminals, hackers, and hostile countries like Russia and China would be able to exploit these weaknesses, putting personal data, businesses, and even national security at risk. There is no such thing as a “safe” backdoor. History has shown that any intentional security vulnerability will eventually be found and abused by bad actors.

&gt;Apple has already responded to this by disabling its most secure cloud storage features in the UK, and they plan to remove them for existing users soon. This shows just how serious the risk is. If companies are forced to weaken encryption, many will either pull services from the UK or leave users exposed to attacks.

&gt;All this will achieve is pushing people like me to switch to services based outside the UK Government’s jurisdiction. If the Government forces UK-based services to introduce security weaknesses, people will simply move their data elsewhere to maintain their privacy and security. This will not make anyone safer—it will just encourage people to use alternatives that the Government has no oversight of.

&gt;Most people store huge amounts of personal data in the cloud—private photos, documents, passwords, financial information, and even medical records. Weakening encryption means none of this will be truly secure anymore. No one should have to choose between using essential technology and keeping their private data safe.

According to Apple security guide:

&gt; The Advanced Data Protection and iCloud.com web access settings can be modified only
by the user. These values are stored in the user’s iCloud Keychain device metadata and can
only be changed from one of the user’s trusted devices. Apple servers can’t modify these
settings on behalf of the user, nor can they roll them back to a previous configuration.

So perhaps a software update will disable the encryption. Wondering if this will also apply to data still E2EE even when ADP is off.

&gt; Are they just gonna shut accounts down that don’t give it over or something

Looks like yes.

I'm disgusted at my Government for pushing this, and would have used the time to remove as much of my encrypted data off iCloud before the deadline.

I'm also saddened that Apple isn't fighting this harder - they were very open and vocal during the Apple-FBI encryption dispute back in 2016.  I recall that Apple declined to create a backdoor due to its policy which required it to never undermine the security features of its products.

They have made some opposition in the past to the proposals that were put into this law, yet the law remains with its ease of being used for overreach.

So here we are - now with unencrypted iCloud features which I had come to value.  However, I am glad they haven't fully rolled over for the belly rub - Keychain, Health, Messages and FaceTime remain encrypted.  Although as it stands, I don't know how much longer for - my trust of my Government is sinking fast with this.

Some pertinent excerpts from Tim Cook's Open Letter during the FBI dispute:

&gt;Customers expect Apple and other technology companies to do everything in our power to protect their personal information, and at Apple we are deeply committed to safeguarding their data.

&gt;Compromising the security of our personal information can ultimately put our personal safety at risk. That is why encryption has become so important to all of us.

1iv6v65,mea2rsq,t1_me9x86n,Vince789,"Cost is easily the biggest advantage of integrated over discrete. Integrating the modem means the modem can share various system components from the AP SoC

We'll have to wait to die shots, but Apple's C1 likely has its own small CPU (maybe tiny Arm or RISC-V cores). Hence an integrated modem usually adds around 10-15mm2. Haven't seen die hots for discrete modems in a long time, but I'd guess they'll likely be around 30-50mm2, maybe 2-3x more transistors

Discrete modems are usually built on a slightly older, AFAIK Qualcomm's latest modems use Samsung's 4nm process (instead of TSMC 3nm). But still it costs more as it's an additional chip, built on a costly leading edge process, and licensing costs for additional CPU cores

Integrated modems should be more efficient than discrete modems. But that's bascially impossible to test/quantify. But clearly sharing resources instead of duplicating should have minor power savings. As well as TSMC 3nm vs Samsung 4nm

That's essentially why Nvidia/TI/Intel had to drop out, while Samsung/MediaTek integrated their own modems to keep up with Qualcomm

Apple’s first in-house C1 modem chip, debuting in the iPhone 16e, represents a significant strategic pivot from Qualcomm dependency toward comprehensive vertical integration. Manufactured using advanced 4nm baseband and 7nm transceiver processes, this silicon breakthrough enables real-time communication with the A18 processor, facilitating dynamic traffic management across cellular networks while supporting satellite connectivity features despite lacking millimeter wave 5G capabilities in its initial iteration.

The development process entailed rigorous validation through sophisticated simulations, stress tests exceeding tens of thousands of power cycles, and extensive carrier compatibility verification with 180+ providers spanning 55 countries—methodologies overseen by key executives including Johny Srouji, Kaiann Drance, and Arun Mathias in Apple’s specialized testing facilities.

Beyond the immediate performance enhancements evidenced by the iPhone 16e’s record-setting battery life for a 6.1-inch model, this technology establishes the foundation for a unified connectivity architecture across Apple’s ecosystem, simultaneously reducing external licensing expenditures while granting unprecedented control over hardware integration that portends evolutionary refinements in subsequent C-series modems.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",11,0,11,False,[],0,1740215192.0,0,2025-02-22T09:06:32Z

iPhone SE’s successor lost the SE’s key feature: low price

In the lead-up to this week’s Apple announcement, we had a good idea of what to expect from the new iPhone.

For a while now, various reports had the specs right. A18 chip, 8GB of RAM, iPhone 14-style design with Face ID, Apple Intelligence support, USB-C, and more.

Even the new name—iPhone 16e—had leaked in advance, though there was still a fair amount of skepticism about that change.

We were expecting an iPhone SE successor, and didn’t exactly get one. The name change itself isn’t the reason for that, but the price absolutely is.

* iPhone SE: $429
* iPhone 16e: $599

That is no longer a ‘budget’ smartphone.
Rumors of a price change existed, but they largely pointed to a $499 starting price.

Apple’s decision to go with $599 hints at more price changes ahead.",27,0,27,False,[],0,1740157190.0,0,2025-02-21T16:59:50Z

Additionally, the Chinese company happened to be located less than 30 minutes away from our production facility which made installation much easier, whereas our EU and US options would have had to ship the parts and go through customs, adding additional delay.

1iv2c4w,me29gs9,t3_1iv2c4w,ControlCAD,"&gt;When Apple revealed the Vision Pro in 2023, it called the $3,500 headset its next “major platform.” Two years later, and a year after going on sale, the device is thin on apps. 

&gt;Apple doesn’t regularly release stats on the number of Vision Pro apps that are available, and it’s hard to tell how many new apps come out in any given month. According to consultancy AppFigures, which tracks Apple’s platforms, the number of new Vision Pro apps has declined every month since the device hit the market in February 2024.

&gt;When Apple unveiled the Vision Pro, executives said that developers would be able to create new experiences that weren’t possible with traditional computers. But so far, top developers remain mostly focused elsewhere, and major tech companies like Google, Meta and Netflix have yet to release their most important apps for the headset.

&gt;Many of the new apps and ideas for the Vision Pro are coming from independent developers, hacking on the weekends while holding down day jobs. 

&gt;One person in the indie camp is Adam Roszyk, a programmer in Poland who has created 17 Vision Pro apps since the headset was first released.

&gt;For $4, Roszyk’s Night Vision app lets a Vision Pro user tap the depth-sensing cameras of the device to see objects in the dark. If you spend $5, you can perform a chore in a Luigi’s Mansion-like video game using the app Vacuume, which overlays virtual coins on your floor that you can vacuum up, along with any real dirt or dust. And for $6, Roszyk’s app Scan Export lets users create a 3D digital scan of an entire building just by walking around, a useful tool for those in construction or real estate. 

&gt;“We are still early, and we don’t really know how it can be really useful in your life,” Roszyk said. “There’s so many different ideas that just come to your mind.”

&gt;Roszyk continues to work on Vision Pro apps because he said he believes “spatial computing” — Apple’s preferred terminology for headset and glasses technology that can integrate 3D objects with the world around them — will be the next big platform. Roszyk is betting that developing apps now can put him in prime position when more people are walking around with a Vision Pro or, perhaps some day, lightweight glasses. 

&gt;“This type of computing is the future,” Roszyk said. “I would definitely compare it to the first iPhones.”

&gt;Roszyk’s efforts have made him money, but not enough for Vision Pro development to become his full-time job. His 17 apps have cleared about $4,000 on the App Store in the last three months. That number is growing as he releases more apps and more people find out about them, Roszyk said. 

&gt;Apple updated its most recent Vision Pro app count in August, with CEO Tim Cook telling investors on an earnings call that the platform had 2,500 apps. That number covers fully immersive apps that overlay virtual objects over the real world as well as 2D apps with some spatial components.

&gt;By AppFigures’ count, less than 1,900 of these apps remained active at the end of January.

&gt;There are also about 1.5 million Vision Pro apps that are ported versions of iPhone and iPad apps. Apple automatically ports iPhone and iPad apps to the Vision Pro when they’re uploaded, but companies can decline. Those apps can be used inside the headset but appear as 2D flat screens. Meta started to emulate that strategy last year with 2D Android apps for Quest, but the company doesn’t have the same library of millions of existing mobile apps.

&gt;Apple doesn’t publish Vision Pro sales, but one estimate from IDC suggests fewer than 1 million devices have been sold.

&gt;Some services like Netflix and YouTube, and game streaming services like Nvidia GeForce Now can be accessed through the Apple Vision Pro’s browser. And existing apps often receive updates that introduce a spatial mode, such as the NBA scores app, which recently got an experimental feature that allows users to watch a live basketball game as if the players were miniature figurines on a table.

&gt;Apple Arcade, a monthly game subscription from Apple, does require that its titles support the Vision Pro in addition to iPhones and iPads. Apple Arcade developers are paid by Apple and their apps are free to subscribers.

&gt;Although many of those games are 2D, some are exclusive to the Vision Pro. In January, Apple released Gears &amp; Goo, a Vision Pro app that enables the player to control an army of goofy frog-like characters on a table in the real world.

&gt;The Vision Pro app gold rush has seen slower uptake than the iPhone’s app boom. 

&gt;A year after the iPhone App Store was launched in 2008, Apple was crowing about the platform having 50 million customers, 2 billion downloads and 85,000 apps. Apple regularly told investors and developers how much money it had paid from App Store sales — it hasn’t released any similar stat for the Vision Pro.

&gt;Many in the VR industry hoped Apple’s entry would kick off a boom like the iPhone did for mobile apps, creating fortunes as millions of users sought to fill their new devices with fresh software.

&gt;“My assumption back then was whatever Apple releases might be in that final form, so it’s a good idea to be ready as early as possible,” said Nikhil Jacob, who runs Reality Uni, which publishes content about developing apps for the Vision Pro. “But my assumption there ended up being wrong.”

&gt;Jacob said he believes that an app developer ecosystem for the Vision Pro will take a lot longer to build out than it did for the iPhone because key pieces are missing. Jacob hopes Apple improves the Vision Pro app store to help users find new apps.

&gt;The slow uptake, due largely to the high price tag, has led some to worry that VR and its related technologies are once again entering a lull.

&gt;“Winter has come,” said Jarrett Webb, who develops headset apps for Argodesign, a software consultancy. “Even Apple couldn’t produce a winner.”

&gt;Still, some optimism remains among Vision Pro developers. 

&gt;They say that Apple’s hardware is solid, the company’s developer tools are improving, and that the Vision Pro lays the groundwork for future software and hardware updates. It also helps that Vision Pro owners still seem to be excited to try out new apps.

&gt;Apple’s entry into the headset market, combined with Google’s recent announcement of its own Android XR platform, as well as Meta’s billions of dollars of investment signals that there will be a market for VR content, said John Gearty, who worked on the Vision Pro at Apple and is the founder of PulseJet Studios, a VR production house focusing on music. Gearty is hoping for steady growth from the market, but he has tempered his expectations. 

&gt;Apple has not said if it will update the Vision Pro. According to analysts, the company is working on a successor. Developers want it to be lighter and less expensive. They welcome any improvements that would get it on more faces.

&gt;“Over time, everything gets better, and it too will have its course of getting better and better,” Cook told The Wall Street Journal in October. “I think it’s just arguably a success today from an ecosystem-being-built-out point of view.”",29,0,29,False,[],0,1740174006.0,0,2025-02-21T21:40:06Z

1iuo1kz,me852w9,t1_me71n1b,cuentanueva,"&gt; The foldable will never become anything more than a niche product. 

People, including Steve Jobs, said the same thing about phablets. Now every phone have screens that are 6 or almost 7 inches.

And even if it does become a niche thing, it doesn't mean it wouldn't make sense to make anyway.

&gt; Not until batteries become substantially better.

They have bigger batteries _right now_ than non-foldable phones like the iPhone Pro Max or even than the Mini.

Granted, those could have _significantly_ bigger batteries the day Apple and Samsung adopt the same battery tech. But we've deal with this amount of battery life for a decade and most people are ok with it. 

So I don't think battery life is a problem now that they can have such large capacity batteries.

&gt; The price point you're suggesting also makes zero sense. 

That's the price point they currently have though. They are all around ~1800.

When the tech improves they might come down, but for now that seems to be it.

&gt; But a phone that can open up to be a tablet is quite useless atm.

It could also be a phone that folds in half (like the Flip style), and those are the most popular.

&gt;At that price point most people would rather get a regular iPhone and an iPad.

Well, obviously not everyone. An iPad Mini wouldn't be pocketable and as easy to carry as having a foldable phone that goes into the size of your normal iPhone. 

For some people, one portable device would win over two ""better"" specialized ones. For me, with the current tech it isn't, but it would be likely in a couple years. And for many obviously it's enough already.

&gt; And mini had devout fans just not enough sales.

Well, if it didn't sold, they it didn't have that many devout fans.

I still think there's a difference when it's a nice cheap device, where the margins are lower, compared to an expensive premium one with extra margins.

In any case, it seems Apple is interested, or these rumours wouldn't exist. We'll see how it turns out. 

IMO, it will make foldables significantly more popular. And while it will obviously not be the most sold device, I don't think it will not sell.",2,0,2,False,[],0,1740256419.0,5,2025-02-22T20:33:39Z

Of _all phones_ is painting it on a bad light on purpose. Especially for a new and very expensive technology.

They are significantly more expensive than the average smartphone. Almost twice as much as even the most premium ones.

According to a quick Google, the S24 Ultra sold like 16 million units. The Fold 6 has sold over 2 million and the Flip almost 3 million.

That's 1/3rd of what their top of the line product has sold is absolutely not bad.

And neither the Fold nor the Flip are the best options in the market.

Today’s “exclusive” information about Apple’s foldable comes from Weibo-based leaker Digital Chat Station, and it concerns the screen measurements. According to the Chinese leaker, the device has a 5.49-inch outer screen that resembles the new Oppo Find N5, but is shorter and wider. Meanwhile, the inner screen is 7.74 inches and unfolds like an iPad. Apparently both displays have an “unprecedented aspect ratio.” Apple’s foldable phone will launch next year or the year after that, says the leaker, with a foldable iPad also expected to arrive within the same time frame.

Looking for advice: my AirPods stopped connecting to Bluetooth, I took them in to the Apple Store to get repaired, was told $99 for a new battery and agreed to that. Then I got an email saying they found another issue : “There is a hardware issue affecting the normal function of the ethernet port.” Is all the email said.

I never use the Ethernet port so I don’t necessarily care if it’s broken, but the email gives me the option to pay $399 or get the item back.

I’m pretty disappointed as I bought these in March 2022 I thought they would last much longer than this. Do you have any suggestions on how to proceed?

1iu9fbf,mdvg496,t3_1iu9fbf,ControlCAD,"&gt;Apple will use its own custom-designed Wi-Fi chip in all upcoming iPhone 17 models, according to industry analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.

&gt;Writing in a post on X (Twitter), Kuo said the switch to in-house Wi-Fi chips will ""enhance connectivity across Apple devices"" while also giving Apple a cost reduction.

&gt;All current iPhone models are equipped with a combined Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chip supplied by Broadcom, but Kuo has previously said he expects Apple to equip ""nearly all"" of its products with its own in-house Wi-Fi chip ""within about three years.""

&gt;Kuo in October predicted that at least one iPhone 17 model launching next year will be equipped with an Apple-designed Wi-Fi chip. In the previous report, Kuo said Apple's chip would support ""the latest Wi-Fi 7 spec,"" but he did not provide any further details, and his latest post does not mention a Wi-Fi version number.

&gt;All four iPhone 16 models already support Wi-Fi 7 with Broadcom's chip, but they have some limited specifications.

&gt;Jeff Pu, another analyst who covers companies within Apple's supply chain, said in November 2024 that only the iPhone 17 Pro models will be equipped with an Apple-designed Wi-Fi 7 chip, but Apple's plans may have changed since then.

&gt;With Wi-Fi 7 support, iPhone 17 models could leverage the 2.4GHz, 5GHz, and 6GHz bands simultaneously when paired with a compatible router, enhancing data transfer speeds, reducing latency, and improving overall connection stability. Qualcomm states that Wi-Fi 7 can achieve peak speeds exceeding 40 Gbps, making it up to four times faster than Wi-Fi 6E.

&gt;Apple's Wi-Fi chip is distinct from the C1 modem chip that Apple debuted in the iPhone 16e on Wednesday. However, it is believed that Apple wants to combine these into a single component. Ultimately, the goal is to create a wireless setup where the components are tightly integrated and more energy efficient, allowing Apple to cut down on the battery use of cellular, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth technologies.",66,0,66,False,[],0,1740085973.0,0,2025-02-20T21:12:53Z

On iPhone 16 models, Visual Intelligence lets you use the camera to learn more about places and objects around you. It can also summarize text, read text out loud, translate text, search Google for items, ask ChatGPT, and more.

The feature is activated via the Camera Control button that's exclusive to iPhone 16 models. It was thought that the extra button was necessary to activate the feature, but the new iPhone 16e lacks such a button. Instead, Visual Intelligence can be assigned to the device's Action button or enabled via Control Center.

Now, Apple has told [Daring Fireball's](https://daringfireball.net/2025/02/thoughts_and_observations_on_todays_iphone_16e_announcement) John Gruber that Visual Intelligence is coming to the iPhone 15 Pro ""in a future software update."" Like the iPhone 16e, the iPhone 15 Pro doesn't have a Camera Control button, but Apple says the function will be able to be launched in the Control Center interface or via the Action button once the update drops.

Apple would not confirm whether the update in question is iOS 18.4, beta releases for which are expected any day now. But given that the iPhone 16e will become available to buy on February 28, iOS 18.4 seems like the most likely update that will bring Visual Intelligence to the iPhone 15 Pro.

This is likely why your phone dies quicker after an update. Apple says this in the Battery section of settings when it occurs and what to expect

First, unified memory is shared, but it is not the same as “shared memory.” It is similar, but with key differences

You’re disingenuously comparing the carve out of the iGPU to the entire system of M chips. I don’t understand how you’re legitimately comparing this. Wake me up when the while system, not just the iGPU — which software and the OS need to be optimized to take advantage if — uses unified memory. Mac apps and the OS itself are all hard coded to with zero copy APIs. It works transparently to developers.

Integrated GPUs from AMD and Intel have not had dozens of hundreds of GB to work with. Your foolish comparison demonstrates you only see keywords, not cully understanding the concept between each chip.

I think some looking harshly at this and brushing it off as useless are ""coping"". I can't even think of a time where a benchmark ahead of an imminent launch was way off the mark?

BUT please hear me out here; there's a silver lining to this result.

Yes, it's normal and understandable that a Macbook Air will throttle. It's fanless, after all. It doesn't work under the same premises as a Macbook Pro, iMac or a Mac mini. _However_ the performance increase of the M4 is also so much that this 5% shortage in OpenCL &amp; Metal should still far surpass the M3 performance. The M4 performs roughly 25% better than the M3 in this particular benchmark.

Besides, this is a synthetic and not actual use result, and that is _not_ cope. It's just an innate limitation of benchmarks at large that they don't test your actual use; they test a CPU + GPU being hammered for some time.

Importantly in this case, actual use don't tend to hammer your hardware other than for limited periods of time, in which time they also usually don't have time to get too hot and throttled.

Summarized I think by far most people buying Macbook Air M4 will have their expectations met. If there's a temperature concern I'd have, it'd be about it feeling hot on your lap or not, not whether throttling will noticeably impact typical use.",2,0,2,1740131991.0,[],0,1740131410.0,0,2025-02-21T09:50:10Z

Original Comment: When I first set up an iPad for my son I used my own apple account, which I think is somehow causing this mess. We have long since set him up with his own account and that is what his iPad uses.

The issue is that when we open the family settings on his iPad his name is wrong. It lists the first names/nicknames of all family members. In our case it shows his sister's name and age, my nickname ""Mom"" as organizer, and then he is also listed as ""Mom (me).""

I can't figure out how to fix this. I double checked in his apple account that everything was correct. He has no phone number associated with his apple account, and it's his email in there. I don't understand how apple is still linking him with my apple account/nickname.

I reset his iPad and pulled nothing in from the cloud, thinking maybe that was the issue. Didn't work. I went into my organizer profile on both PC and my iPhone and I just don't see where this is coming from.

Internet works on the mobile network on the phones and when hot spotting the laptop.

Restarting the router does not help.
There are no IP address conflicts and reserving addresses to these devices does not help.
Restarting the devices does not help.
Restarting the network adapter does not help.
The devices are all running the latest operating system updates.

Some reading suggested pressing the 'Renew DHCP Lease' button on the laptop, which worked once, but two days later the issue was back and now pressing the same button does not work.

Since BT is decentralized, they needed that collaboration for their products to be viable. You can't have each company with their own ""BT network"". Customers wouldn't buy into that. So SIG developed and patented the tech, and then licences that out to anyone who wants to make their own BT device. 

The main difference with cell is that it's way more difficult (expensive) and there's only a few cell networks in every country (centralized). So the incentives flip. Instead of it being more profitable to work together on licencing. Its more profitable to beat everyone else to the punch, patent your tech, and make them pay you to license it (or don't license it at all in a vertical company like Apple)

That 35% is almost exactly matches what I used in the calculation:

500$ \* 0.65 = 325$ \* 10% import tariff = 32.5$ \~= 30$.

I’m not sure. All I know is their US unit sales of the 16 were not stellar by their desires, and the VR sets were not stellar sellers either. I think Apple is more concerned about keeping people in the ecosystem and growing the customer base, so eating it now, and keeping production abroad, means that in the end they still will get lower labor costs, the tariffs eventually leave, and then they can raise prices down the road without having lost customers in this phase.

Trump thinks tariffs 1.) make companies produce everything here, and 2.) make some foreign country pay us money.

Irrelevant. This phone just came out, we're comparing launch prices.

LOL, they really were not. It was the same, generation old design, with then current guts. Exactly the same.

15 Pro is no longer on sale. Pointless comparison. And no, it's not.

&gt;I'm not sure how the $400 ($518 in today's dollars) that I paid for my 32GB SE gets you to $660.47

Because the lowest tier was discontinued and the 16e is taking place of the one step up one, therefore we're comparing it to the $499 one, not the cheapest one. 

Actually, we're comparing it to the $479 SE3, which actually makes your comparison to the 1st one even worse, because it was literally the *most* expensive one, out of the four.

&gt;dropping the price down to $500 + adding in the missing features would have made it a budget phone

Yes, that makes total sense. That device already exists, it's called iPhone 16 and costs several hundred dollars more. Are you slow?

1it99nx,mdmwn0e,t3_1it99nx,ControlCAD,"&gt;Apple has officially discontinued the iPhone 14 and ‌iPhone 14‌ Plus, removing them from its product lineup following the announcement of the iPhone 16e.

&gt;The ‌iPhone 14‌ and ‌iPhone 14‌ Plus were introduced in September 2022 as the standard models in Apple's annual smartphone refresh, positioned below the higher-end Pro models. At the time of their discontinuation, the ‌iPhone 14‌ was priced at $599, while the ‌iPhone 14‌ Plus was available for $699, marking a reduction from their original launch prices of $799 and $899, respectively.

&gt;The standard ‌iPhone 14‌ retained a 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR display, while the ‌iPhone 14‌ Plus introduced a 6.7-inch variant—the first time Apple offered a large-screen option on a non-Pro model. Unlike previous years, there was no ‌iPhone 14‌ mini, as Apple opted to replace the compact 5.4-inch model with the larger Plus variant.

&gt;Both devices were powered by the A15 Bionic chip, which had originally debuted in the iPhone 13, featuring a 5-core GPU for improved graphics performance. They also gained Crash Detection, which leveraged onboard sensors to detect severe car accidents and automatically contact emergency services if the user was unresponsive, and Emergency SOS via satellite, allowing users to communicate with emergency responders in areas without cellular or Wi-Fi connectivity.

&gt;The camera system was enhanced with the introduction of the Photonic Engine, a computational photography technology aimed at improving low-light performance across all cameras. Additionally, the front-facing TrueDepth camera received autofocus for the first time to improve sharpness in selfies and video calls.

&gt;It's worth noting Apple has never discontinued a mainline ‌iPhone‌ midway through the year before. With their removal from Apple's website, the company's non-Pro lineup now consists of only the ‌iPhone 16e‌, iPhone 15 and ‌iPhone 15‌ Plus, and iPhone 16 and ‌iPhone 16‌ Plus.",1,0,1,False,[],1,1739982030.0,0,2025-02-19T16:20:30Z

1isstyg,mdjacfd,t3_1isstyg,ControlCAD,"&gt;Over the years, Apple has switched from an aluminum frame to a stainless steel frame to a titanium frame for its highest-end iPhones. And now, it has been rumored that Apple will go back to using aluminum for three out of four iPhone 17 models.

&gt;In an investor note with research firm GF Securities, Apple supply chain analyst Jeff Pu said the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max will all be equipped with aluminum frames. Interestingly, though, he expects Apple's rumored iPhone 17 Air model to have a titanium frame.

&gt;This would be a notable change for the Pro models, as all of the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro models have titanium frames, resulting in the devices weighing less than iPhone 14 Pro models with heavier stainless steel frames.

&gt;Aluminum frames were already rumored for the iPhone 17 Pro models once before.

&gt;Pu said Apple plans to use aluminum for the iPhone 17 Pro models due to environmental considerations. Aluminum generally has a lower carbon footprint compared to titanium, and Apple is aiming to achieve carbon neutrality for all of its products and supply chain by 2030. Following in the footsteps of the Apple Watch, and the latest Mac mini, perhaps some iPhone 17 models will be advertised as Apple's first carbon-neutral iPhones.

&gt;It is unclear why the iPhone 17 Air would have a titanium frame, as aluminum is lighter than titanium, which would be fitting for the device's thin and light design. We may have a partial explanation, though. Last year, fellow Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said the iPhone 17 Air's frame would use a mix of titanium and aluminum, with a lower amount of titanium compared to the iPhone 15 Pro models. Apple surely has its reasons here, so hopefully we will find out more details before the iPhone 17 series is unveiled in September.",24,0,24,False,[],0,1739927542.0,0,2025-02-19T01:12:22Z

eg have a details:

$4 Patreon

Personally I think what apple should do is provide an API that trusted payment providers (stripe, Braintree etc) can use to provide an out of process payment sheet (like the apps tore payment sheet) so that users are never entering card details directly into an app.   (the reason is all these apps have so many third party tracking and ads network (closed source) packages that tend to snoop on every single key press so if you enter you card number into an app there is a 100% chance that is duplicated now within 10 to 30 separate third party databases and the app dev might not even now about it can cant do anything about it.  So it would be so much better if all payment details (and confirmation) happened within a seperate app overlay provided by the trusted payment provider that does not canton all this junk.

And that Sheed should have a details button that expands to provide this breakdown.  Then apple could even still charge the 15% to 30% but only on the section of the payment that is not going to the upstream creator.",17,0,17,False,[],0,1739954208.0,1,2025-02-19T08:36:48Z

Lmfao, uh, so Arm the team and company today supposedly didn’t benefit because of Apple as a co-founder. Makes sense. Apple co-founded Arm (by the way, which is different from ARM, the ISA), hired the first CEO, used their processor in a new product, then with the rebirth of Apple in 1997, Apple created the iPod and based it off an ARM processor, and then did the same thing with iPhone in 2007. Apple literally donated the ARM V8 ISA. Everything Arm is today is because of Apple constantly pushing adoption of it and creating desirable products with their technology, which is leading to my point that Arm is not simply a “European company” that American technology didn’t influence. 

&gt;V8 is not just Apple contributions. 

Ex-Apple engineers have directly stated it was, and it’s evidenced by Apple making the first 64 bit mobile phone processor, and V8 set them up for M1, which brought ARM to the desktop seriously for the first time. Apple and Arm are intricately linked in ways most companies aren’t

The sensitive relationship between the two countries is demonstrated by secretive discussions between officials in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, which substituted the Apple name for “the fruit company,” including in private conversations.

China understands the threat that India poses to its manufacturing dominance, and it’s being proactive about the perceived problem.

Gurman’s latest claim flips the previously expected order of devices to transition from M4 to M5 chips, which was based on last year’s M4 product launch order. Apple first introduced its M4 chip in an updated iPad Pro in May 2024, followed by the MacBook Pro in October, but it sounds like Apple will deviate from that timeline this time around.

Before the release of M5 MacBook Pro models, Gurman says that Apple will launch updates to the Mac Studio and Mac Pro using its current generation M4 chip series. Those machines could arrive around Apple’s annual Worldwide Developers Conference in June 2025.

The M5 series is expected to feature an enhanced ARM architecture and is reportedly being manufactured using TSMC’s advanced 3-nanometer process technology. Apple’s decision to forgo TSMC’s more advanced 2nm process for the M5 chip is believed to be due to cost considerations.

What happened was the programmers literally made the game in a dark room and just had the glow of their monitors. So the game was perfectly viewable for them, because they never once considered that people might play the game in a well-lit room with natural sunlight.

So now someone puts in the prompt ""criminal"" with no other prompts or input text. The LLM looks through its training data and sees that 80% of the time the word ""criminal"" is associated with Black faces. So when it averages out all of those faces, it's going to end up with one with a dark skin tone.

It's not just race, it's *everything*. One common complaint with the image generation model Flux is that if you're not very careful with your prompting every woman has exactly the same face. That's because it takes every photo with tags like ""woman"" and averages out all their faces, which leads to the same output result.

That's all all LLMs are, really - just devices for taking a huge amount of data and producing the most average, more generic result.
