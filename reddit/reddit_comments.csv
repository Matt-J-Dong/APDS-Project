1ix366p,meisz2t,t3_1ix366p,ControlCAD,"&gt;Sir Jony Ive, the innovative designer of Apple’s iMac, iPhone and Apple Watch, and a close friend and ­collaborator of the late Steve Jobs, says he still often asks himself: “I wonder what Steve would do?”

&gt;Ive told BBC Radio 4’s Desert Island Discs on Sunday that he does so despite the fact that Jobs had specifically told him not to before his death in 2011, aged 56.

&gt;“He used to say I really don’t want you to be thinking ‘Well, what would Steve do?’,” Ives said.

&gt;The designer, who was born in Chingford, Essex, and moved to San Francisco to work at Apple in 1992, worked alongside the company’s ­co-founder and CEO five years later, when Jobs was called back in to help the struggling company after a period working elsewhere.

&gt;Jobs’ return marked an immediate improvement for Ive, he recalled. “It was remarkable that, despite the limitations of my ability to communicate, Steve understood what I thought and how I felt,” Ive said.

&gt;He told host Lauren Laverne that he feels Jobs’ reputation as demanding and ruthless is unfair: “If you have such a clear, pure view of ­creating something new … if you are serious about actually wanting to develop and make it, you can’t just say ‘well, here’s an idea’ because if that’s how you’re going to behave, it will remain an idea.”

&gt;He added that he couldn’t read anything about Jobs for 10 years after his death.

&gt;The designer, who grew up in Staffordshire, bemoaned the lack of understanding about art and design in many schools and recalled how he felt his intelligence was questioned by teachers because he was shy and wanted to spend time making things.

&gt;Fears that the technology he has helped to create could now be interfering with human creativity worry Ive, he said, adding that he finds it difficult to monitor his own use of technology. While he praised all the benefits that have flowed from the arrival of the iPhone, he said he feels a responsibility for the unintended, negative aspects. This is in his mind when he makes decisions about the tech of the future, he added.

&gt;Ive’s concern about the threat posed by AI is mixed with his excitement about its possibilities, he said. His main worry is the unchecked speed of development. “We need time to understand and react,” he said. He did not give details of the AI project he spoke about working on last autumn with OpenAI CEO, Sam Altman, but is enthusiastic: “It’s probably the first time in my career that I’m inspired by capability in this way.”",15,0,15,False,[],0,1740407326.0,0,2025-02-24T14:28:46Z

1ix2yxw,meiqlq7,t3_1ix2yxw,chrisdh79,"From the article: Apple plans to launch a second-generation AirTag in May or June this year, according to a post today from a leaker known as [Kosutami](https://x.com/Kosutami_Ito/status/1893941895761444872).

Bloomberg's Mark Gurman previously reported that a new AirTag would be released in mid-2025. May or June would align with that timeframe.

Below, we recap three new features rumored for the AirTag 2:

* With a second-generation Ultra Wideband chip, the AirTag 2 is expected to have up to 3× longer range compared to the current AirTag. The chip debuted in the iPhone 15 and the Apple Watch Ultra 2. On the iPhone 15 and iPhone 16 models, there is a Precision Finding for People feature that can help you to find your friends in crowded places, and it offers a range of up to 200 feet/60 meters.
* The new AirTag's built-in speaker is expected to be more difficult to remove or tamper with, as an anti-stalking safety measure.
* The new AirTag is rumored to have improved integration with the Apple Vision Pro.

The original AirTag was announced during an Apple Event in April 2021. In the U.S., an individual AirTag costs $29, and a set of four costs $99.

Kosutami is best known as a collector of prototype Apple products, but they have occasionally shared accurate information about Apple's future plans. For example, they accurately revealed that the iPhone 16 Pro would be equipped with a metal-enclosed battery many months before the device launched. However, their August 2024 claim that new AirPods Pro would be coming ""soon"" did not pan out, as AirPods Pro 3 have yet to launch.

In another post today, Kosutami seems to be once again implying that new AirPods Pro are on the horizon, along with new Apple smart home accessories. Apple is expected to unveil an all-new smart home hub this year, and it is also rumored to be working on a Face ID doorbell and a smart home camera for release in 2026 or later.",198,0,198,False,[],0,1740406521.0,0,2025-02-24T14:15:21Z

I frequently use my iPhone, mounted on top of a proper video camera as a b cam shooting a basic wide shot. 

By shooting in log im able to get the two cameras to match properly. 

It really is amazing to have such a high end image coming off such a small device. 

For my money there are two key areas that Apple can improve to make the iPhone a better professional video tool

1. Either add a variable aperture lens or some sort of electronic ND. 

Bottom line is, we need to be able to shoot with a 180 degree shutter. 

The fixed f1.7 aperture lens is no good for video. An iPhone lens that could go from f1.7 to f16 or lower would be an instant upgrade for me

2. It’s such a darn pain getting files off the iPhone. 

While the Pro iPhones now get usb3 transfer speeds, in practice. This just isn’t the case. Transferring files off the iPhone, via a wire, within that weird finder view is both painful and extremely slow. 

Beyond that some open gate recording modes so we can capture the entire sensor would be welcome. 


But I suspect that to come for vloggers, they’re gonna be introducing some kind of lidar enabled subject detection autofocus mode and perhaps a tally light  on the back of the phone?

Samsung et al have benefitted from Qualcomm’s chip being all-in-one, which boosts performance and power efficiency. So the fact that Apple has been outclassing Android phones many times on battery life despite that major disadvantage goes to show they know what they’re doing, and the recent boost of 5 hours from 16 hours to 21 hours of video streaming from the 14 to 16e shows Apple can increase battery life with their modem.

Lmfao a moderator removed someone’s negative comment on Gurman.

Gurman sucks, and he has to say a bunch of obvious stuff to counter his obvious misses.
